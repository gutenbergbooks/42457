<h2 class="nobreak">PREFACE</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>F this little book purported to be a biography in
the ordinary sense of the word, the scantiness of
purely personal detail relating to its hero might
be a fair subject of criticism. But men of the Glyndwr
type live in history rather by their deeds, and the
deeds of those they lead and inspire. This is peculiarly
the case with the last and the most celebrated
among the soldier patriots of Wales. Though
so little remains to tell us of the actual man himself,
this very fact has thrown a certain glamour and
mystery about his name even in the Principality.
While numbers of well-informed Englishmen are inclined
to regard him, so far as they regard him at
all, as a semi-mythical hero under obligations to
Shakespeare for such measure of renown and immortality
as he enjoys, if the shade of Henry the
Fourth could be called up as a witness it would tell
a very different story. It is at any rate quite certain
that for the first few years of the fifteenth century,
both to England and to Wales, to friends and
to foes, Owen was in very truth a sufficiently real
personality. What we do know of him, apart from
his work, might well suggest infinite possibilities to
the novelist and the poet. It is my business,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>iv]</a></span>
however, to deal only with facts or to record legends and
traditions for what they are worth, as illustrating
the men and the time.</p>

<p>Glyndwr is without doubt the national hero of
the majority of Welshmen. Precisely why he takes
precedence of warrior princes who before his day
struggled so bravely with the Anglo-Norman power
and often with more permanent success, is not now
to the point. My readers will be able to form some
opinion of their own as to the soundness of the
Welsh verdict. But these are matters, after all, outside
logic and argument. It is a question of sentiment
which has its roots perhaps in sound reasons
now forgotten. There are in existence several brief
and more or less accurate accounts of Glyndwr&rsquo;s
rising. Those of Thomas, written early in this century,
and of Pennant, embodied in his well known
<i>Tours in Wales</i>, are the most noteworthy,&mdash;while
one or two interesting papers represent all the recent
contributions to the subject. There has not
hitherto, however, been any attempt to collect in
book form all that is known of this celebrated Welshman
and the movement he headed. I have, therefore,
good reason to believe that the mere collection
and arrangement of this in one accessible and handy
volume will not be unwelcome, to Welsh readers
especially. Thus much at least I think I have
achieved, and the thought will be some consolation,
at any rate, if I have failed in the not very easy task
of presenting the narrative in sufficiently popular
and readable guise. But I hope also to engage the
interest of readers other than Welshmen in the story
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>v]</a></span>
of Glyndwr and his times. If one were to say that
the attitude of nearly all Englishmen towards Wales
in an historical sense is represented by a total blank,
I feel quite sure that the statement would neither
be denied nor resented.</p>

<p>Under this assumption it was thought well to attempt
a somewhat fuller picture of Wales than that
presented by the Glyndwr period alone, and to lead
up to this by an outline sketch of Welsh history.
The earlier part, particularly, of this contains much
contentious matter. But in such a rapid, superficial
survey as will fully answer our purpose here, there
has scarcely been occasion to go below those salient
features that are pretty generally agreed upon by
historians. The kind manner in which my <i>Highways
and Byways of North Wales</i> was received, not
only by English readers but by Welsh friends and
the Welsh press, makes me venture to hope that my
presumption as a Saxon in making this more serious
excursion into the domain of Welsh history will be
overlooked in consideration of the subject dealt
with.</p>

<p>A continuous intimacy of many years with the
Glyndyfrdwy region begat a natural interest in the
notable personage who had once owned it, and this
gradually ripened into a desire to fill, however inadequately,
what seemed to me an obvious want.
Before venturing on the task I took some pains to
ascertain whether any Welsh writer had the matter
in contemplation, and so far as information gathered
in the most authoritative quarters could be effective
it was in the negative. As this was at a time when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>vi]</a></span>
the Welsh people were considering some form of
National memorial to Glyndwr, the absence both in
fact and in prospect of any accessible memoir of
him overcame what diffidence on racial grounds I
had naturally felt and encouraged me in my desire
to supply the want.</p>

<p>A full list of the authorities I have consulted in
the preparation of this work would, I have reason to
understand, be too ponderous a supplement to a
volume of this kind. Before noting any of them,
however, I must first acknowledge the very great
obligations I am under to Professor Wylie for his
invaluable and exhaustive history of Henry IV.; not
merely for the information contained in the text of
his book, but for his copious notes which have been
most helpful in indicating many sources of information
connected with the persons and events of the
time. The following are some of the chief works
consulted: Dr. Powell&rsquo;s translation of Humphrey
Lloyd&rsquo;s <i>History of Wales</i> from the chronicle of
Caradoc of Llancarvan, Ellis&rsquo; original letters, <i>Annales
Cambri&aelig;</i>, Rymer&rsquo;s <i>F&oelig;dera</i>, Williams&rsquo; <i>History of
Wales</i>, Warrington&rsquo;s <i>History of Wales</i>, Tyler&rsquo;s <i>Henry
V.</i>, Adam of Usk, Matthew of Paris, Hardyng&rsquo;s and
other chronicles, Giraldus Cambrensis, the historians
Carte, Walsingham, and Holinshed, Bridgeman&rsquo;s
<i>Princes of South Wales</i>, Lloyd&rsquo;s <i>History of
the Princes of Powys Fadog</i>, the Iolo MSS., Owen&rsquo;s
<i>Ancient Laws and Institutions of Wales</i>, <i>Arch&aelig;ologia
Cambrensis</i>, the Brut, and, of course, the Rolls
series. Among living writers who have been helpful
in various ways and have my best thanks are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>vii]</a></span>
Mr. Robert Owen, of Welshpool, the author of
<i>Powysland</i>, the Revd. W.&nbsp;G. Dymock Fletcher, of
Shrewsbury, who has made a special study of the
neighbouring battle-field; Professor Tout, who has
published an interesting lecture on Glyndwr and
some instructive maps connected with the period;
and Mr. Henry Owen, the well known authority on
Pembrokeshire and author of <i>Gerald the Welshman</i>;
nor must I omit a word of thanks to Mr. Owen
Edwards, whose kind encouragement materially influenced
my decision to undertake this book.</p>

<p>I am under most particular obligations to that
well known Welsh scholar, Mr. T. Marchant Williams,
for suggestions and criticisms when the book
was still in manuscript, and also to my lamented
friend, the late Mr. St. John Boddington, of Huntington
Court, Herefordshire, for assistance of a
somewhat similar nature.</p>

<p>I am also greatly indebted to Miss Walker, of Corwen,
for several photographic scenes in Glyndyfrdwy,
which she most kindly took with an especial view to
reproduction in these pages, and to Messrs. H.&nbsp;H.
Hughes and W.&nbsp;D. Haydon, both of Shrewsbury,
who rendered a like service in the matter of Glyndwr&rsquo;s
other residence at Sycherth.</p>

<span class="vsmlfont">INTRODUCTORY SKETCH OF WELSH HISTORY FROM
THE SAXON CONQUEST OF ENGLAND TO THE
RISING OF GLYNDWR<br />
400-1400</span></h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE main subject of this book is the man whose
memory, above that of all other men, the Welsh
as a people delight to honour, and that period
of Welsh history which he made so stormy and so
memorable. But having what there is some reason
to regard as a well founded opinion that (to the vast
majority of English readers) the story of Wales is
practically a blank, it seems to me desirable to prepare
the way in some sort for the advent of my hero
upon this, the closing scene of Cambrian glory. I
shall therefore begin with a rapid sketch of those
nine centuries which, ending with Glyndwr&rsquo;s rising,
constitute roughly in a political and military sense
the era of Welsh nationality. It is an audacious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>2]</a></span>
venture, I am very well aware, and more especially so
when brought within the compass of a single chapter.</p>

<p>Among the many difficulties that present themselves
in contemplating an outline sketch of Welsh
history, a doubt as to the best period for beginning
it can hardly be included. Unless one is prepared
to take excursions into the realms of pure conjecture
and speculation, which in these pages would be altogether
out of place, the only possible epoch at
which to open such a chapter is the Saxon conquest
of England. And I lay some stress on the word
England, because the fact of Wales resisting both
Saxon conquest and even Saxon influence to any
appreciable extent, at this early period, is the keynote
to its history.</p>


<p class="break">What the British tribes were like, who, prior to
this fifth century, lived under Roman rule in the
country we now call Wales, no man may know. We
do know, however, that the Romans were as firmly
seated there as in most parts of Britain. From their
strong garrisons at Chester, Uriconium, Caerleon,
and elsewhere they kept the country to the westward
quiet by means of numerous smaller posts. That
their legions moved freely about the country we
have evidence enough in the metalled causeways
that can still be traced in almost every locality beneath
the mountain sod. The traces, too, of their
mining industry are still obvious enough in the
bowels of the mountains and even beneath the
sea, to say nothing of surface evidence yet more
elaborate. That their soldiers fell here freely in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>3]</a></span>
cause of order or of conquest is written plainly enough
in the names and epitaphs on mortuary stones that
in districts even now remote have been exposed by
the spade or plough. But how much of Christianity,
how much of Roman civilisation, these primitive
Britons of the West had absorbed in the four centuries
of Roman occupation is a matter quite outside
the scope of these elementary remarks. Of civilisation
beyond the influence of the garrisons there was
probably little or none. As regards Christianity, its
echoes from the more civilised parts of the island
had probably found their way there, and affected
the indigenous paganism of the mountains to an extent
that is even yet a fruitful source of disagreement
among experts. Lastly, as it seems probable
that the population of what is now called Wales
was then much more sparse in proportion to the rest
of the island than in subsequent periods, its condition
becomes a matter of less interest, which is
fortunate, seeing we know so little about it.</p>

<p>With the opening of the fifth century the Romans
evacuated Britain. By the middle of it the Saxon
influx, encouraged, as every schoolboy knows, by
the Britons themselves in their weakness, had commenced.
Before its close the object of the new-comers
had developed and the &ldquo;Making of England&rdquo;
was in full operation.</p>

<p>For these same conquered Britons many of us, I
think, started life with some tinge of contempt,
mingled with the pity that beyond all doubt they
fully merit. Mr. Green has protested in strong
terms against so unjustifiable an attitude. He asks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>4]</a></span>
us to consider the condition of a people, who in a
fiercely warlike age, had been for many generations
forbidden to bear arms; who were protected by an
alien army from all fear of molestation, and encouraged,
moreover, to apply themselves zealously to the
arts of peace. That men thus enervated made a
resistance so prolonged is the wonder, not that they
eventually gave way. If this nation, which resisted
for a hundred years, is a fit subject for criticism,
what can be said of their conquerors who, five centuries
later, in the full enjoyment of warlike habits and
civil liberty, were completely crushed in seven by a
no more formidable foe?</p>

<p>While the pagan Saxons were slowly fighting their
way across England towards the Severn and the
Dee, the country about and behind these rivers had
been galvanised by various influences into an altogether
new importance.</p>

<p>After the departure of the Romans, the Welsh
tribes, less enervated probably than their more Romanised
fellow-countrymen to the east, found in the
Scots of Ireland rather than the Picts of the North
their deadliest foes. It was against these western
rovers that the indigenous natives of what for brevity&rsquo;s
sake we are calling Wales, relearnt in the fifth
century the art of war, and the traces of their conflicts
are strewn thick along the regions that face the
Irish Sea. But while these contests were still in
progress, three powerful tides of influence of a sort
wholly different poured into Wales and contributed
towards its solidity, its importance, its defensive
power, and its moral elevation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">400-500,
Cunedda.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>5]</a></span>(1) Out of the north, from Cumbria and Strathclyde,
came the great prince and warrior Cunedda,
whose family seem to have taken possession,
with or without resistance, of large
tracts of Wales, Merioneth, Cardigan, and many other
districts deriving their names in fact from his sons.
His progeny and their belongings became in some
sort a ruling caste; a faint reflection of what the
Normans were in later days to England.</p>

<p>Cunedda is said to have held his Court at Carlisle,
and to have wielded immense power in the north
and north-west of Britain. If he did not go to Wales
in person he undoubtedly planted in it his numerous
and warlike offspring, who, with their following, are
usually regarded as the founders of the later tribal
fabric of Wales, the remote ancestors, in theory at
any rate, of the Welsh landed gentry of to-day; but
this is a perilous and complex subject.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Christianity.</div>

<p>(2) In this century, too, came the first wave of a
real and effective Christianity, with its troops of missionaries
from Brittany and Ireland, in the
front rank of which stand the names of St.
David and Germanus or Garmon, Bishop of Auxerre.
The latter is generally credited with the organisation
of the Welsh Church, hitherto so vague and undefined.
It was, at any rate, during this period, that
the Church assumed definite territorial form, and
that the Welsh diocese and the Welsh parish, their
boundaries roughly approximating to the present
ones, came into existence. Through the fifth,
sixth, and well into the seventh century, church
building and religious activity of all kinds flourished
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>6]</a></span>
marvellously in Wales; while Christianity was being
steadily and ruthlessly stamped out over the rest of
Britain by the advancing pagans, native chieftains
vied with foreign ecclesiastics in building churches,
cathedrals, and cells; and great monastic houses
arose, of which Bangor Iscoed, on the Dee, with its
two or three thousand inmates, was the most notable.
The mountainous region that in former days had
been among those least influenced by it was now
the hope of the island, the seat of religious fervour,
the goal of the foreign missionary and the wandering
saint.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Arrival of the
Saxons, 577.</div>

<div class="sidenote">British refugees
in sixth
century.</div>

<p>(3) The third, and perhaps not the least powerful,
factor in the making of Wales was the advance of the
Saxons. After their great victory of Deorham
they destroyed the British strongholds
of Bath, Gloucester, and Cirencester, and about
the year 577, or 130 years after their first landing
in Britain, they appeared on the Severn. The
exact fate or disposal of the natives, whom with
ceaseless fighting they thus drove before them, is a
matter of perennial controversy. The ferocity of the
conquerors, aggravated, no doubt, by the stubborn
resistance of the conquered, is a fact beyond all
question and should be emphasised, since its direful
memories had much to do with the inextinguishable
hatred that was felt for so many centuries, and to a
certain degree is still felt, by many Welshmen towards
their Saxon foes. It may fairly be assumed
that the extirpation (though the term is much too
strong) of the native stock was most marked in the
eastern parts of Britain, and that as the tide of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>7]</a></span>
conquest swept westward its results in this particular
were much modified. But however great the slaughter
or however considerable the native element that
was retained upon the soil by its conquerors, it is
quite certain that the influx of British refugees into
Wales throughout the sixth century must have been
very large. Among them, too, no doubt,
went numbers of men and women of
learning, of piety, and sometimes perhaps
even of wealth, for one need not suppose that every
Briton waited to be driven from his home at the
spear&rsquo;s point.</p>

and Shrewsbury.</div>

<p>A fierce onslaught in great force brought the invaders
to the walls of the Roman-British city of
Uriconium, where Cynddylan, Prince of
Powys, with all the power of Central
Wales, made a vain but gallant effort to
arrest the ruin:</p>

<p>He and his brothers were at length all slain, and his
armies routed. Uriconium or Tren was sacked, and
higher up the valley the royal palace at Pengwern,
as Shrewsbury was then called, was destroyed.</p>

<p>These terrible scenes are described for us by
Llywarch H&ecirc;n, one of the earliest British bards,
himself an actor in them, who thus laments over the
wreck of Pengwern:</p>

<div class="sidenote">Augustine
and the Welsh
bishops, 601.</div>

<p>By the close of the sixth century Christianity had
been introduced by Augustine into the south-eastern
corner of England, and there is no more
suggestive scene in Welsh history than the famous
meeting of the great missionary with the Welsh
bishops on the banks of the Severn. It accentuates
in a striking manner the cleavage between the
Eastern or the Latin Church, and that of the West
and of the Welsh. Augustine, about the
year 601, fresh from his victories over
paganism among the Kentish Saxons, and
having journeyed far through still heathen regions,
approaches these Western Christians with a kindly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>9]</a></span>
but somewhat supercilious and superior air. The
seven Welsh bishops&mdash;or so-called bishops, for the
full development of the office as understood later
was not yet completed&mdash;were ready waiting for
him on the banks of the lower Severn. They were
a deputation of the Welsh Church, and, seeming
already to scent patronage in the air, were fully
prepared to resent any sign of it in the Roman missionary.
The latter, it appears, knew very little
about the Western Church, with its roots in Ireland,
Armorica, and Gaul, and what he did know he did
not like.</p>

<p>The arrogance of Augustine fully justified the
Welshmen&rsquo;s suspicions, and he still further roused
their indignation by hinting that they should take
their instructions and receive their consecration from
Canterbury, as representing Rome. Coming from a
man who appeared to them but the missionary
bishop of a handful of recently converted barbarians,
this was a little too much for ecclesiastics who
had behind them three or four centuries of Christianity,
and knew nothing whatever of the Latin Church.
Augustine, too, spoke disparagingly of their customs,
and with particular severity of the absence of celibacy
in their Church. This must have touched them
to the quick, seeing that numbers of the offices and
benefices in the Western Church were more or less
hereditary, and that even saintship was frequently
a matter of family, the tribal sentiment being predominant.
All these things, together with their difference
in Easter observance and in shaving the
head, horrified Augustine, and he spoke so freely as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>10]</a></span>
to put all hope of combination out of the question.
Indeed, the Welsh divines were so offended that
they refused even to break bread beneath the same
roof as the Roman saint. At a second conference
Augustine, seeing he had gone too far, proposed
that, even if they could not conform to each
other&rsquo;s customs, they should at least combine in
efforts to convert the rest of England. Such endeavours
did not commend themselves in the least to
the Welshmen. Whatever missionary zeal may have
existed among Welsh churchmen it did not include
the slightest anxiety about the souls of the accursed
conquerors of Britain, the ruthless ravagers and destroyers
of their once civilised and Christian country.
It is probable that Augustine did not realise the
fierce hate of the despoiled Celt towards the Saxon.
At any rate his patience at length gave way, and as
a parting shot he in effect told the Welshmen that
since they shewed themselves so criminally careless
about Saxons&rsquo; souls, they should of a surety feel the
prick of Saxon spears. This random threat, for it
could have been nothing more, was strangely fulfilled
within a few years&rsquo; time, when the victory of
the pagan Ethelfred at Chester, which sundered the
Britons of Wales from those of North-Western England,
culminated in the sacking of Bangor Iscoed
and the slaughter of twelve hundred monks.</p>

<div class="sidenote">601.</div>

<p>This futile conference of 601 marks the beginning
of the long struggle of the Welsh or Ancient British
Church to keep clear of the authority
of Canterbury, and it lasted for some
five hundred years. Till the close of the eleventh
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>11]</a></span>
century the bishops of the four Welsh dioceses were,
as a rule, consecrated by their own brethren. St.
David&rsquo;s perhaps took rank as &ldquo;primus inter pares&rdquo;
for choice, but not of necessity, for there was no
recognised Welsh metropolitan. Ages afterwards,
when Canterbury had insidiously encroached upon
these privileges, the Welsh clergy were wont to
soothe their wounded pride by the assurance that
this transfer of consecration had come about as a
matter of convenience rather than of right. Long,
indeed, before the final conquest of Welshmen by
Edward the First, their Church had been completely
conquered, anomalous though such an inverted process
seems, by Norman bishops. A Welshman,
though his sword might still win him political recognition
and respect, had little more chance of Church
preferment in the thirteenth century than he had in
the eighteenth or the first half of the nineteenth.
As early indeed as 1180 that clerical aristocrat of
royal Welsh and noble Norman blood, Giraldus
Cambrensis, pertinently asks the same question
which from generation to generation and from reign
to reign through the Hanoverian period must have
been on every native churchman&rsquo;s tongue in the
Principality, &ldquo;Is it a crime to be a Welshman?&rdquo;</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Latin and
British
Churches.</div>

<p>There is no occasion to enlarge upon the subtle
methods by which the Norman Church anticipated
the Norman sword in Wales. Sleepless
industry no doubt was one. Another
was the agency of the newer monasteries,
filled with Norman, English, and foreign monks and
for the most part devoted to the Latin Church.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>12]</a></span>
Persistent denial of the validity of St. David&rsquo;s in the
matter of consecration may in time, too, like the
continuous drip of water on a stone, have had its
effect upon the Welsh, even against their better
judgment. On one occasion we know that some of
their princes and nobles, stung by what they regarded
as excessive exactions on the part of the
Church, stooped so far as to throw in the faces of
their prelates the taunt that their consecration was
invalid. Such an attitude did not tend to lighten
the immense pressure which was exercised in favour
of the supremacy of Canterbury; and long before
Welsh princes had begun to take orders from Norman
kings, Welsh bishops were seeking consecration
from Canterbury, unless indeed their thrones were
already filled by Norman priests.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Divisions of
Wales.</div>

<p>It is not only the ecclesiastical but also the secular
divisions of Wales, that in a great measure date from
these fifth and sixth centuries. The three chief
Kingdoms, or Principalities, into which the country
was apportioned, stand out from these days with consistent
clearness till they are gradually broken into
fragments by the Norman power: On
the north was Gwynedd; in the centre,
Powys; on the south, Deheubarth or South Wales.
As St. David&rsquo;s was the premier see of the four Welsh
dioceses, so Gwynedd was even more markedly the
first among the three Welsh Kingdoms. Its ruler,
when a sufficiently strong man to enforce it, had a
recognised right to the title of &ldquo;Pendragon&rdquo; and
the lip homage of his brother princes. When a
weak one, however, filled the precarious throne, any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>13]</a></span>
attempt to exact even such an empty tribute would
have been a signal for a general outbreak.</p>

<p>Gwynedd included the present counties<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> of Flint,
Anglesey, Carnarvon, and most of Merioneth, together
with the northern part of Denbighshire.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a>
The present counties of Wales were not in existence as such till
after the final conquest by Edward I. Even then, as we shall see,
only six were created; the larger part of the Principality retaining its
feudal lordships until the reign of Henry VIII. There were ancient
subdivisions of the three Welsh Kingdoms ruled over by petty
Princes owing allegiance to their immediate overlord; and their
names still survive in those of modern counties or districts. Ceredigion,
for instance, remains as Cardigan, Morganwg as Glamorgan,
while the vale of Edeyrnion and the county of Merioneth still preserve
the memory of two sons of the conquering Cunedda. But the
units of old Welsh delimitation were the &ldquo;Cantrefs&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Commotes,&rdquo;
which even to this day are often used for purposes of description,
as well as occasionally for ecclesiastical and political divisions.
Of Cantrefs there would be something like three to the modern
county, while each &ldquo;Cantref&rdquo; again consisted of two &ldquo;Commotes.&rdquo;
<a href="#FNanchor_1_1">Back</a></p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">Powys.</div>

<p>Powys cannot be so readily defined in a line or
two, but, roughly speaking, it was a triangle or wedge
driven through Central Wales to a point
on the sea, with a wide base resting on the
English border, the present county of Montgomery
representing its chief bulk. Its capital was Pengwern
or Shrewsbury, till the eighth century, when
Offa, King of Mercia, enraged at the inroads of the
Welsh, gathered together his whole strength and
thrust them permanently back from the plains of
Shropshire to the rampart of hills along whose crests
he made the famous Dyke that bears his name.
Thenceforward Mathraval, and subsequently Welshpool,
became the abode of the Princes of Powys.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>14]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Deheubarth.</div>

<p>The Southern Kingdom, or Deheubarth, was also
something of a triangle, but reversely placed to that
of Powys, its point lying on the English
border, and its broad base stretching along
the Irish Sea from the mouth of the Dovey to the
capes of Pembroke.</p>

<p>Of these three divisions, Powys, as will be obvious
even from the brief and crude description of its
boundaries here given, had the greatest difficulty in
holding its own against both Saxon and Norman.
South Wales, on the other hand, was the thorniest
crown, for it included to a greater degree than the
others semi-independent chieftains, such as those of
Morganwg and Cardigan, who were inclined to pay
their tributes and their homage only when their overlord,
who held his Court at Dynevor on the Towy,
was strong enough to enforce them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Warfare in
Wales.</div>

<p>Thus for nearly seven centuries there were separate
sources of strife in Wales, and three distinct
classes of warfare. First there came the
meritorious defence of the country against
Saxon, Dane, and Norman, in which, upon the whole,
there was much creditable unanimity. Secondly,
during the lulls from foreign invasion, there was
almost constant strife between North and South,
Powys holding as it were the balance of power
between them. Lastly there were the purely provincial
quarrels, when heady chieftains fell out with
their superiors, as a form of entertainment to which
South Wales, as I have already remarked, was peculiarly
prone.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Roderic divides
Wales,
877.</div>

<p>But, after all, it is not quite accurate to give such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>15]</a></span>
emphasis to the existence and definition of the three
Kingdoms till the death of Roderic the Great in
877. Several kings had essayed with varying
success to rule all Wales, but it was
Roderic who with scanty foresight finally
divided the country between his three sons, laying
particular stress on the suzerainty of Gwynedd. The
prevalent custom of gavelkind worked admirably, no
doubt, in private life among the primitive Welsh, but
when applied to principalities and to ambitious and
bloodthirsty princelings the effect was usually disastrous.
To mitigate the dangers of his unwise partition,
Roderic ordained a scheme which would have
proved of undoubted excellence if the practice had
only been equal to the theory. This was to the
effect that if any two of the Princes of Wales quarrelled,
all three were to meet in conclave in the wild
pass of Bwlch-y-Pawl, through which the present
rough road from Bala to Lake Vyrnwy painfully
toils. Here they were to settle their difficulties
peacefully; and as it was presumed that only two
would be parties to the quarrel, the third was to act
as arbiter. For some centuries after this we know
very well that the successive rulers of the three
Kingdoms drenched Wales in blood with their quarrels,
but no tradition remains of a single conference
at this wild spot among the hills, where the infant
Vyrnwy plunges down through heathery glens and
woods of birch and oak to the most beautiful artificial
lake perhaps in Christendom.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cadvan.</div>

<p>The sins of omission must of necessity be infinite
in dealing with so vast a subject in so compressed a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>16]</a></span>
space, and sins of omission, if not confessed in detail,
sometimes affect the accuracy of the whole. Something,
for instance, ought to be said of the pastoral
character, even in these early days, of all Wales, except
perhaps Anglesey and West Carnarvon; of the
tribal organisation and the laws of gavelkind; of
the domestic and family nature of the Church, whose
minor benefices at any rate were largely hereditary,
and whose traditions were intensely averse to centralisation.
Among other things to be noted, too, is
that Cadvan, who flourished in the seventh
century, is generally regarded as the first
genuine King of Wales, just as Roderic, nearly three
hundred years later, was the great decentraliser.</p>

<div class="sidenote">815. Saxons
conquer
Cornwall.</div>

<p>Another important date is that of 815, when a
Saxon victory in Cornwall destroyed the last vestige
of British independence in England. For
hitherto the Britons of Wales had by no
means regarded themselves as the mere
defenders of the soil they occupied. Steeped in the
prophecies of Merlin and his contemporaries, which
assured them of the ultimate reconquest of the
whole island of Britain, they still cherished dreams
which may seem to us by the light of history vain
enough, but in the opening of the ninth century they
still fired the fancy of a proud, romantic, and warlike
race.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Saxons made
little way.</div>

<p>Amid the conflicting evidence of rival chroniclers,
Saxon and Welsh, it is not often easy to select
the victors in the long series of bloody
combats that continued throughout the
centuries preceding the Norman Conquest. Whatever
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>17]</a></span>
victories the Saxons gained, they were not
much less barren than their defeats. Nominal conquests
were sometimes made of the more vulnerable
districts, but they were not long maintained. At
the next upheaval such loose allegiance as had been
wrung from the provincial ruler was repudiated
without a moment&rsquo;s thought, and often indeed the
Saxons beyond the border found themselves in their
turn fighting for hearth and home.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Danes,
890.</div>

<p>In the ninth century the Danes appeared upon
the scene. Though they harried Wales from time
to time, both in the interior and on the
coast, their doings in England were so incomparably
more serious that their Welsh exploits
almost escape our notice. About the year 890,
Danish outposts were established beneath the Breiddon
hills, that noble gateway of mid-Wales, through
which the Severn comes surging out into the Shropshire
plains. Hither four years later came that
formidable Danish leader, Hastings, with the Anglo-Danish
forces of East Anglia and the north behind
him. King Alfred, who was in the west, hastened to
the scene and contributed to this strange spectacle
of Saxons and Cymry fighting side by side. A decisive
victory at Buttington, near Welshpool, rewarded
their efforts, and though the struggle between Dane
and Saxon was of great service to Wales by bringing
a long immunity from the attacks of her hereditary
foe, the Danish name calls for little more notice in
Welsh annals.</p>

<p>Seeing that vague dreams of reconquest still lingered
among the Welsh, England&rsquo;s difficulty, to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>18]</a></span>
apply a familiar modern aphorism, should have been
Cambria&rsquo;s opportunity. But readily as the three
Welsh Princes, when their common country was in
danger, were accustomed to combine, and efficiently
as they raided in independent fashion across the
English border, cohesion for a serious aggressive
movement was almost hopeless. The moment that
they were safe, they turned their arms against each
other. The whole history of Wales, from the days
of Roderic to those of Edward, with a few brief
intervals, is one long tale of bloody strife.</p>

<div class="sidenote">No Saxon
settlement.</div>

<p>Nor were the Princes of Gwynedd, Powys, and
Deheubarth always content to fight their quarrels
out alone. As time went on they grew more accustomed
to their Saxon neighbours, even if they did
not love them more. Occasional amenities became
possible. Intermarriages between the two aristocracies
were not unknown, and when they had progressed
thus far a Prince of Powys would scarcely
have been human if he had not occasionally
been tempted to call in Saxon aid against his
powerful rivals of Gwynedd or Deheubarth. But in
spite of this dangerous game, played often enough
and in later Norman days so fatal, the soil of Wales,
so far as any serious occupation or dominion is
implied, remained inviolate throughout the whole
Saxon period.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Victory of
Anarawd, 878.</div>

<p>One very narrow escape from a permanent
lodgment of Saxons, of which the
Welsh chronicle tells us, should not perhaps
be passed over. It occurred in the
days when Anarawd, one of the sons of Roderic,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>19]</a></span>
was ruling over North Wales, at the close of the
ninth century. More than a hundred years before,
the Mercians, under Offa, had driven the Welsh
finally from Shropshire and pressed them back behind
the famous Dyke, whose clearly marked course
still preserves the name of their warlike monarch.
The great Saxon victory on Rhuddlan March, at
the mouth of the Clwyd, had occurred soon afterwards,
and the wail of the defeated is still sounded
in one of the most notable of Welsh airs. But
Offa&rsquo;s Dyke had been since then considerably overleaped,
and the slaughter of Rhuddlan had been
long avenged. When the descendants of these same
Mercians poured once more into the pleasant country
that lies upon the north shore between Chester and
the Conway, the invaders of the &ldquo;Perfeddwlad,&rdquo; as
this region was then called (a term I shall use for
convenience throughout this chapter), proved too
powerful for Anarawd. He was driven back into
Snowdonia and Anglesey, and the Saxons settled
down in the Vale of Clwyd and upon either side of
it, with a deliberation that, but for an opportune accident,
would have probably converted a large slice of
North Wales into a piece of England for all time.
But just as the Strathclyde Britons in the days of
Cunedda had brought to Wales in the time of her
need after the Roman departure a valuable
and warlike element, so their descendants,
four centuries later, came just in time to
save what are now the Celtic districts of
Flint and northern Denbigh from becoming Saxon.
These people, hard pressed in north Lancashire,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>20]</a></span>
Cumberland, and even beyond, by Danes and Saxons,
decided to seek a new home, and their thoughts
naturally turned to Wales. They made overtures
to Anarawd, begging that he would grant them of
his abundance sufficient territory for their needs.
But Anarawd&rsquo;s kingdom had, as we have seen, been
sadly circumscribed, and his homeless subjects from
the east of the Conway were already on his hands.
A bright thought struck him, and he informed his
Strathclyde kinsmen that if they could reconquer
the Perfeddwlad they were welcome to it. Necessity,
perhaps, nerved the arms of the wanderers,
and the Saxons, who, as Dr. Powell quaintly puts
it, &ldquo;were not yet warm in their seats,&rdquo; were driven
headlong out of Wales. The Mercians,
however, were not the kind of men to sit
quietly down after such an ignominious expulsion;
they made vigorous preparations for taking their
revenge, and retrieving their fortunes and their
honour. The Strathclyde Britons sorely doubted
their powers of resistance to the great force which
now threatened them, so, carrying all their cattle and
effects back again across the Conway, they begged
Anarawd in his own interest as well as in theirs to
support them. The Prince of Gwynedd rose nobly
to the occasion and, joining all his forces to those
of his immigrant kinsmen, they met the returning
Saxon invaders near Conway, and in a pitched
battle drove them back to the Dee with prodigious
slaughter, never to return. So the country between
the two rivers was preserved to the Cymric
race and saved from becoming, as for the moment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>21]</a></span>
looked extremely probable, another Cheshire or
Shropshire.</p>

<p>Anarawd, however, could not rest content with
his triumph over the Saxons. As an illustration of
the thirst for war that seems to have been chronic
with most of the Welsh Princes, it may be noted
that, with the Saxons vowing vengeance on his
borders, he did not hesitate to march into South
Wales and make an unprovoked attack upon its
Prince, his own brother.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Howel Dda,
940.</div>

<p>But with the death of Anarawd and his brothers,
various contingencies, which need not detain us here,
made Howel Dda, or Howel the Good,
both the heir and the acceptable ruler of
all three provinces. His reign was unique in Welsh
annals, for it was not only long, but almost peaceful.
This excellent Prince turned his brilliant talents and
force of character almost entirely to the civil and
moral elevation of his people. He drew up his
famous code of laws, which, as is sometimes asserted,
unconsciously influence the legal instincts of remoter
Wales even to this day. In the preparation of this
great work he summoned his bishops and nobility
and wise men to meet him at Ty Gwyn on the
Towy, for it should be noted that this ruler of a
temporarily united Wales was in the first instance
Prince of Deheubarth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The laws of
Howel Dda
enacted.</div>

<p>Here this select assembly spent the whole of Lent,
fasting and praying for the Divine aid in
their approaching task. Howel then picked
out from among them the twelve most
capable persons, with the Chancellor of Llandaff
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>22]</a></span>
at their head, and proceeded to examine in exhaustive
fashion all the laws of the Cymry. Of
these they eliminated the bad, retained the good,
and amended others to suit present requirements.
This new code was then ratified by the entire assembly
before it dispersed. Three copies were made,
and it is significant of the change already creeping
over the Welsh Church, that Howel and his four
bishops are said to have journeyed to Rome and submitted
one of them to the Pope for his approval.
The Laws of Howel Dda may be read to-day by anyone
with access to a reference library. The rights
of every class of person are herein clearly set forth,
and the precise value of each man&rsquo;s life according to
his rank, and of every animal&rsquo;s hide and carcase accurately
defined. The tribal sanctity of land, too, is
well illustrated by a law forbidding the owner of
an estate to mortgage it to anyone but a kinsman.
Books, harps, swords, and implements of livelihood
were exempted from distraint, while among livestock
horses were placed in the same category, as being
necessary for defence. Suits in connection with land
could not be heard between February and May, or between
May and August, since these were the periods
of seed-time and harvest, while all cases touching inheritance
were to be heard by the King himself. The
latter is pictured to us as sitting in his judicial chair
above the rest of the Court, with an Elder upon either
hand and the freeholders ranged upon his right and
left. Immediately below the King sat the Chief Justice
of the Province, with a priest upon one side of
him and the Judge of the Commote upon the other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>23]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Value of articles
fixed by
Howel Dda.</div>

<p>After hearing witnesses and taking depositions, the
two judges and the priest retired to consider the
verdict. This done, the King took counsel with
them, and, if he agreed, delivered judgment himself.
If the case was too involved, however, for a satisfactory
decision, the matter was settled by the simple
expedient of single combat. A fixed price, as I have
remarked, was set upon almost everything, both living
and inanimate. One is surprised, for instance, to
find an apple tree worth 60<i>d.</i>, and a tree
planted for shelter worth 24<i>d.</i>, while a
coracle is only worth 8<i>d.</i> A salmon net
is appraised at just double the last amount, while a
spade, again, is rated at a penny only. Though the
skin of an ox or hart is fixed at 8<i>d.</i> the near extinction
of the beaver is significantly shewn by its value
of 120<i>d.</i> Dogs, too, vary most curiously on the list.
A common cur is held at 4<i>d.</i>, a shepherd dog at 60<i>d.</i>,
and the best sporting dogs at four times the latter
sum. There is special mention, too, of chargers,
hunters, roadsters, pack-horses, and draught-horses
for carts and harrows. Horses are not to be broken
till their third year; while three rides through a
crowd is the legal test of &ldquo;warranted broken.&rdquo; Cows
and mares, too, are prohibited from ploughing. We
learn also in this singular price-list the current value,
among other things, of a battle-axe, a bow with
twelve arrows, a white-hilted sword, a shield enamelled
with blue and gold; of plaids, too, striped
and chequered stuffs, mantles trimmed with fur,
robes, coats, hose, buskins, shoes, gloves, caps, bonnets,
girdles, and buckles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>24]</a></span>
There are stringent laws against cruelty to animals
and in favour of hospitality. Game laws existed
of the strictest kind, classifying every animal
of the chase and dealing with the management of
hounds, and the etiquette of hunting. For their
ardour in these pursuits, the Welsh were distinguished
among nations, not being surpassed even
by the Normans themselves.</p>

<p>The customs obtaining in the royal household are
tabulated in Howel Dda&rsquo;s code with extraordinary
minuteness, and the duties of every official, from
highest to lowest, strictly defined; from the Chaplain,
Steward, Judge, and Master of the Horse down to
the porter and birdkeeper. The perquisites, it may
be noted, of the Master of the Horse are all colts
under two years old, taken in war, and all gold and
silver spurs thus acquired; those of the porter,
every billet of wood he could snatch from a passing
load, with one hand, as he held the gate with the
other, and any swine out of a herd that he could lift
breast high by its bristles only!</p>

<p>Of the bards there is so much to be said elsewhere
that we need only remark here that the duties of the
Bardd Teulu, or Poet Laureate, were to follow the
army and sing the &ldquo;Unbennaeth Prydain&rdquo; or &ldquo;Monarchy
of Britain&rdquo; before, and if triumphant after,
the battle; to perform at all times before the Court,
and also privately to the Queen, only in so low a
tone as not to disturb the King and his courtiers.
This illustrious functionary was valued at 126 cows.</p>

<p>A remarkable official was the &ldquo;Crier of Silence,&rdquo;
who beat a particular pillar in the great hall with a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>25]</a></span>
rod when the noise became excessive, and had for
his perquisites the fines that were exacted for any
such undue boisterousness. Strangest by far of all
was the King&rsquo;s &ldquo;footholder,&rdquo; whose duty it was to
sit under the table at meals and nurse his Majesty&rsquo;s
foot, and to &ldquo;scratch it when required.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nor can we forget the &ldquo;Pencerdd,&rdquo; the Chief of
Song, who was of popular election and presided
at the Bardic Gorsedd held every third year, and
held only at Aberffraw in Anglesey, the royal residence
of Gwynedd; for the Eisteddfodau were held
by all the Welsh Princes apparently at will. The
Pencerdd was expected to know by heart the prophetic
song of Taliesin. He lodged in the quarters
of the heir apparent, and was presented by the King
with a harp and key.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Renewed
conflicts, 950.</div>

<p>Howel the Good died about 950. With the divisions
and disputes of his sons and nephews Wales
quickly lost its unanimity, and once more
the flame of war was lit from one end of the
country to the other by these foolish broilers, in
attempts to despoil each other of their respective
portions. The question was at length settled for a
while by a great battle at Llanrwst, where the men
of North Wales utterly discomfited those of the
South, pursuing them with fire and sword far beyond
the northern boundaries of Deheubarth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Growing intercourse
between
Welsh
and Saxon.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Eadgar
rowed by
Welsh Princes
on the Dee.</div>

<p>Towards the close of the tenth century
we begin to get glimpses of those amenities
between Cymry and Saxon, which a
now common religion, a common foe in
the Danes, and considerable private intercourse, had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>26]</a></span>
rendered inevitable. We find King Eadgar himself,
for instance, at Bangor, helping Iago ap Idwal, Prince
of Gwynedd, against his nephew Howel ap Ievan.
Everything, however, being amicably arranged, the
Saxon King actually remains in friendly fashion at
Bangor, and bestows gifts and endowments upon its
see. Finally the two recent disputants return with
Eadgar to Chester, and take an oar in that celebrated
crew of kinglets which rowed the Saxon
monarch upon the Dee. Gwaithvoed,
Prince of Powys, who was invited to assist
in this somewhat inglorious procession,
seems to have been the only one of the Welsh
<i>Reguli</i> who refused the honour. &ldquo;Tell the King,&rdquo;
said Gwaithvoed, &ldquo;I cannot row a barge, and if I
could, I would not do so, except to save a life,
whether king&rsquo;s or vassal&rsquo;s.&rdquo; On being pressed by
a second messenger from Eadgar, his brief answer
was: &ldquo;Say to the King, &lsquo;Fear him who fears not
death.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is not easy to define the precise attitude of
the Welsh Princes towards the King of England as the
Saxon period drew towards its close. Though the
ancient Britons had become crystallised into Welshmen,
the old tradition of the island as a whole with
an &ldquo;Emperor&rdquo; in London, and a general scheme of
defence against foreign foes, was not yet dead. The
Saxons, though little loved, had become an accepted
fact, and there seems to have been no particular reluctance
among the Welsh princes to pay lip homage,
when relationships were not too strained, to the
&ldquo;King in London,&rdquo; and tribute, too, as representing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>27]</a></span>
the ancient contribution to &ldquo;the defence of the
island.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="sidenote">Llewelyn I.,
1000.</div>

<p>For the last hundred years prior to the Norman
conquest, one follows the bloody path of
Welsh history in vain efforts to find some
breathing space, wherein rulers turned
their attention to something besides the lust of
power and the thirst for glory. It was about the
year 1000 when the first of the three Llewelyns succeeded
to the throne of North Wales. Under a
King whose title was absolutely indisputable, and
who possessed some force of character, it seemed as
if the sword was now for a season, at any rate, to remain
undrawn. But it was not to be; for in no long
time the throne of South Wales fell vacant, and
there was, unhappily, no direct heir. So the nobles
of the Province, fearing, and with some reason, that
Llewelyn would seize the opportunity to attach the
Southern Kingdom to his other dominions, brought
forward a creature of their own, a low-born adventurer,
who claimed to be of the royal lineage. This
precipitated the catastrophe which it was designed
to prevent, and Llewelyn fell upon Deheubarth with
the whole force of Gwynedd. The fight lasted
through a whole day, and the slaughter was immense,
but the Northerners again prevailed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Griffith ap
Llewelyn.</div>

<p>But there were also years of peace under Llewelyn
ap Seisyllt, and of conspicuous prosperity, so the
chronicler tells us, in which &ldquo;the earth brought forth
double, the people prospered in all their affairs, and
multiplied wonderfully. The cattle increased in
great numbers, so that there was not a poor man in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>28]</a></span>
Wales from the south to the north sea, but every
man had plenty, every house a dweller, every town
inhabited.&rdquo; Llewelyn fell ultimately before Carmarthen,
and his throne was seized by Iago ap
Idwal, a collateral relative. He in turn was quickly
overthrown and slain by Llewelyn&rsquo;s warlike
son Griffith, who enjoyed what from
a purely military point of view might be called a
successful reign.</p>

<p>The Danes at this time began again to make attacks
on Wales, but were defeated in Anglesey, and
again in the Severn valley.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Griffith ap
Llewelyn attacks
South
Wales.</div>

<p>Flushed with victory, and without a particle of
excuse, Griffith now turned upon South Wales, ravaged
it with fire and sword, and drove out
its new Prince, Howel ap Edwy. Howel,
however, came back with an army of
Danes and Saxons, so had times changed
in Wales, but only to meet with disaster and defeat
at the hands of the vigorous Griffith. Yet again the
indomitable Howel returned with a fresh army to
try his luck, and so certain was he this time of victory
that he brought his wife to witness it. But
again disaster overtook him, and his wife, instead
of sharing his triumph, was carried off to share his
conqueror&rsquo;s bed.</p>

<p>Thus rolls on the tumult and the turmoil of the
old Welsh story. The wonder is when and how the
laws of the wise and peaceful Howel Dda found
scope for application, and we can only suppose that
the partial nature of these fierce struggles atoned in
some measure for their continuity. Yet through all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>29]</a></span>
this devastation Church property, of which there was
now a considerable amount and of a tangible kind,
seems to have been well respected. The Danes
alone were regardless of shrines and monasteries;
and we hear of them at St. David&rsquo;s and Llanbadarn
and other sacred spots along the seacoast doing wild
work.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1040.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Harold and
Griffith.</div>

<p>The twenty years preceding the battle of Hastings
were busy years in Wales, and the foremost name of
that epoch in England came to be perhaps
more dreaded among the native Welsh
than that of any other Saxon since the days of Offa.
But Harold, Earl of the West Saxons and commander
of the English armies, got much
deeper into Wales than Offa had ever succeeded
in doing, and indeed came much nearer
than any of his predecessors to a conquest of the
country. Griffith ap Llewelyn, Prince of Gwynedd
by right, and of all Wales by force, was, as we have
seen, no mean soldier. He was Harold&rsquo;s adversary,
and the last Welsh Prince to face the Saxon power.
This, the final quarrel of five centuries of strife, was,
for a wonder, not of Griffith&rsquo;s seeking.</p>

<p>We have seen how greatly modified the cleavage
between the two peoples had by now become. Intermarriages
had taken place in the higher ranks, alliances
had been formed, and Saxon influences in
matters such as land tenure and Church government
had been sensibly felt beyond the Severn and the
Dee. So now, while the shadow of the Norman invasion
was hanging over unconscious England, Algar,
Earl of Chester, falling out with King Edward, did
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>30]</a></span>
nothing particularly unusual when he fled to the
warlike son of the first Llewelyn, and tried to embroil
him in his quarrel. Griffith was peacefully hunting
at his second residence at Aber near Bangor, and
had indeed made good use of a few years of peace,
but he was not the man to turn a deaf ear to any
prospect of a fight. The upshot was a very serious
war, in which Griffith and his ally were for a long
time singularly successful. They defeated Edwin of
Mercia in a great battle near Welshpool; they afterwards
took Hereford, won a victory at Leominster,
and penetrated as far as Wiltshire.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Harold in
Wales.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Death of Griffith,
1061.</div>

<p>A brief truce ensued with Harold, who had
been opposing them, and then the struggle began
afresh. The tables were now completely
turned. Harold&rsquo;s memorable invasion
of Wales took place, in which he was assisted to
success by the many enemies Griffith had made in
his high-handed annexation of Deheubarth. The
Welsh Prince, after a stirring reign of
thirty-four years, perished during this
campaign of 1061 at the hand of a hired assassin.
His head, like that of many another Welsh leader,
was sent across the border in a basket, and received
at Gloucester by Harold with much demonstrative
satisfaction. The latter, in the meantime, had
marched to the Conway, and afterwards through
South Wales. He had been victorious everywhere;
and now nominated fresh rulers to the vacant
thrones of Gwynedd and Deheubarth, under promise
of vassalage to the English Crown.</p>

<p>The tenure of the three Welsh Princes was always
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>31]</a></span>
complicated and, indeed, liable to fluctuation with
the balance of power, both in Wales and across the
border. In theory, Powys and South Wales owed
lip homage and a nominal tribute to the Prince of
Gwynedd as &ldquo;Pendragon.&rdquo; The latter, on behalf of
Wales, owed a similar service to the King of England
and, as I have mentioned before, was not inclined
to dispute it so long as his independence was respected.
Harold&rsquo;s so-called conquest only altered
matters to the extent of making the three Welsh
provinces theoretically equal and individually vassals
of the English Crown. This paper arrangement
would have probably remained a dead letter or would
have been maintained just so long as there was an
arm strong enough to maintain it. But a people
were coming to eliminate the Saxon as an aggressive
power, and to take his place,&mdash;a people who would
not be satisfied with lip homage and occasional
tribute.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1066. Welsh
and Normans.</div>

<p>The great struggle in England between Norman
and Saxon seemed by the mere force of contagion
to set the Welsh Princes once more by
the ears. Some of them, however, in accordance
with their generous tradition of loyalty
to the soil of the Britain they had lost, joined
the West Saxons in their resistance to this new and
formidable foe. Others essayed to make use in
their domestic quarrels of the crafty Norman, who
was only too glad to get a finger so cheaply into the
Welsh pie.</p>

<p>The followers of William of Normandy, indeed,
lost no time in turning their attention to Wales.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>32]</a></span>
Within ten years of the battle of Hastings,&mdash;almost
immediately, that is to say, after the completion of
the conquest of England,&mdash;they began their marauding
expeditions across the border, and were not
unnaturally surprised at finding themselves confronted
by a people so entirely different from those
they had just subdued. But these initial successes
taught the Welsh nothing, and they still continued
their fatal internecine strife.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Normans
in Wales.</div>

<p>The first serious lodgments of the Normans were
made at Montgomery, where a baron of that name
built the castle, whose fragments still look
down from their rocky throne upon the
windings of the upper Severn. Rhuddlan, at the
mouth of the Clwyd, the site of an even then ancient
fortress, was next occupied and strengthened.
Flushed with their easy conquest of England, the
Normans had already begun to regard Wales as if it
also belonged to them; and still the quarrelsome
Welsh chieftains continued to engage these formidable
new-comers in their disputes. At Chester,
Hugh Lupus, its Earl of famous memory, and the
nephew of the Conqueror, held in secure confinement
the person of the Prince of Gwynedd whom he had
seized by treachery. He then proceeded to farm
out the realm of the captive prince, but as he only
received &pound;40 as rental the sum is more eloquent than
any words would be to express the nature of the
hold he had won over it. It is more than likely the
contractors had a bad bargain even at that figure.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Lupus, Earl
of Chester, invades
North
Wales, 1075.</div>

<p>In the conspiracy of 1075, when William was on
the continent, many of the Welsh nobles joined, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>33]</a></span>
had consequently their share of the hanging and
mutilating that followed its discovery. Lupus, however,
marched an army through the North
and built or rebuilt castles at Bangor,
Carnarvon, and Anglesey. He was closely
followed by the Conqueror himself, who
with a large force proceeded with little apparent
opposition through the turbulent South, received
the homage of its king, Rhys ap Tudor, and its petty
Princes, and then repaired with great pomp to the
cathedral of St. David&rsquo;s, at whose altar he offered
costly gifts. This kind of triumphal progress, as the
Saxons well knew, though the Normans had yet to
learn the fact, did not mean the conquest of Wales.
King William in this single campaign seems to have
imbibed some respect for Welshmen, for he spoke of
them on his death-bed as a people with whom he had
&ldquo;held perilous conflicts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Infinitely more dangerous to Welsh liberty was
the experiment next tried by a native Prince of acquiring
Norman aid at the expense of territory.
The story of the conquest and settlement of Glamorgan
is such a luminous and significant incident
in Welsh history, and was of such great future importance,
that it must be briefly related.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Norman
settlement
in
Glamorgan.</div>

<div class="sidenote">1091.</div>

<p>The present county of Glamorgan was represented,
roughly speaking, in ancient Wales by the subkingdom,
or, to use a more appropriate term,
the lordship of Morganwg. It had acquired
its name in the ninth century
through the martial deeds of its then proprietor,
&ldquo;Morgan Fawr,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Morgan the Great.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>34]</a></span>
Morganwg, though part of Deheubarth, was at times
strong enough to claim something like independence,
and indeed the uncertain relationships of the smaller
chieftains of South Wales to their overlord at Dynevor
may well be the despair of any one attempting
to combine tolerable accuracy with unavoidable
brevity. But these remarks are only relevant for
the purpose of emphasising the comparative importance
at all times in Wales of the country we call
Glamorgan; and this was due not only to its size
and to its seacoast, but to its comparative smoothness
and fertility. In the year 1091, in
the reign of William Rufus, one Iestyn, a
descendant of Morgan the Great, was ruling over
Glamorgan, and as he was upon anything but friendly
terms with his feudal superior, Rhys ap Tudor,
Prince of South Wales, he bethought him of calling
in alien aid, a habit then growing lamentably common
among Welsh chieftains.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Iestyn and

<div class="sidenote">William

<div class="sidenote">Marriages
with
Normans.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Turberville
at Coity.</div>

<p>The Saxons had ceased to exist as a military
power, and the Normans stood in their shoes. Iestyn
knew nothing of Normans, but he had a
friend named Einion who was reputed to
have had much experience with them. To Einion,
then, he repaired and promised him his daughter&rsquo;s
hand, which presumably carried with it something
substantial, if he would bring a band of Normans
to his assistance in his dispute with Rhys.
Einion consented to be his intermediary and without
much difficulty secured the services of Robert Fitzhamon
and twelve knightly adventurers who served
under him. The Normans in due course arrived and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>35]</a></span>
rendered Iestyn invaluable assistance in resisting his
lawful sovereign. They then, so runs the chronicle,
having received their pay, quite contrary
to Norman custom peacefully re-embarked
at Cardiff and weighed anchor for home. But Iestyn,
before they had well cleared the harbour, was injudicious
enough to repudiate the promise of his
daughter to Einion, whereupon the exasperated
princeling put to sea, interviewed Fitzhamon, and
persuaded him to return with his friends and his
forces and eject the faithless Iestyn from his rich
territory. One may well believe it did not take
much to win over the Normans to so attractive and
congenial an undertaking. At any rate they reversed
their course with much alacrity, returned to Cardiff,
ejected Iestyn, and after some fighting, assisted by
Einion&rsquo;s people, divided the province among themselves,
each building one or more great castles, whose
ruins are notable features in Glamorganshire scenery
to-day. The blood of Fitzhamon&rsquo;s knightly followers
courses in the veins of many an ancient family of
South Wales, and one of them at least is still directly
represented in name as well as lineage. This conquest
must be placed among the earliest in Wales,
and it became the type of many future Norman settlements,
though it was the outcome of an incident,
while the others were for the most part deliberately
planned. The reign of Rufus was memorable for
these filibustering expeditions. They were executed
under the sanction of the King, who found in them a
cheap method of granting favours to his barons, particularly
those who had perhaps not come out so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>36]</a></span>
well as they could have wished in the partition of
England. They might, in short, take of Wales as
much as they could keep, subject only to
holding what they acquired as feudatories
of the King. There will be more to say
about these Marcher barons later on. In the meantime,
Brecheiniog, or Brecon, had been also conquered
by another Norman, Bernard de Newmarch, with a
similar band of followers, and secured by a similar
system of castle building. Montgomery and other
points in North and South Wales had been occupied,
but they were for the most part purely military outposts.
The occupation of Brecon and Glamorgan by
a Norman aristocracy is a salient and permanent factor
in Welsh history. This does not, however, imply
that such filibustering barons were allowed to settle
quietly down in their seats. Before the end of the
reign, indeed, they were driven out, and William
Rufus himself, who marched through Wales more or
less upon their behalf, had, after all, to retire discomfited:
but they were soon back again. It was not
wholly by brute force that they held their own.
Life would hardly have been worth living upon such
terms, and as a matter of fact, so far as one can read
between the lines of these old chronicles, there does
not seem to have been at first the same antipathy
between Norman and Welshman as had formerly existed
between Saxon and Welshman. Marriages carrying
Welsh property with them seem to
have been readily arranged. A singular and
romantic instance of this was in the matter
of Coity Castle, whose ruined walls still hold
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>37]</a></span>
together near Bridgend, and of the Turbervilles who
even yet, after all these centuries, retain their name
and position in Glamorganshire. For Paine Turberville,
one of Fitzhamon&rsquo;s twelve knights, having been
by some mischance forgotten in the distribution of
land, inquired of his chief where he was to look for
his reward. &ldquo;Here are arms and here are men,&rdquo; replied
Fitzhamon; &ldquo;go get it where you can.&rdquo; So
Turberville went to Coity, which was still unconquered,
and summoned Morgan, the Welsh lord, to
surrender it into his hands. Whereupon
Morgan came out leading his daughter,
and passing through the army, with his sword
in his right hand, came to Paine Turberville, and
told him that if he would marry his daughter, and
so come like an honest man into his castle, he
would yield it to him; but if not, said he, &ldquo;let not
the blood of any of our men be lost, but let this
sword and arm of mine and those of yours decide
who shall call this castle his own.&rdquo; Upon that Paine
Turberville drew his sword, took it by the blade
in his left hand and gave it to Morgan, and with his
right hand embraced his daughter. After settling
matters to the satisfaction of all parties he went to
church and married her, and so came to the lordship
by true right of possession; and by the advice of
his father-in-law kept under his command two thousand
of the best of his Welsh soldiers.</p>

<p>Turberville, having now achieved so secure a position
without the aid of Fitzhamon, very naturally
refused to pay him tribute or own him as his overlord,
but voluntarily recognised Caradoc, the son of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>38]</a></span>
the dispossessed Iestyn, as his chief. This caused
unpleasantness, but Turberville, with his two thousand
Welshmen and his father-in-law&rsquo;s help, was too
strong for Fitzhamon, and he had his way. It must
not, however, be supposed that these martial settlers
as a class by any means followed the example of the
later Norman adventurers in Ireland, and became
&ldquo;more Welsh than the Welsh themselves.&rdquo; They
were too near their King, at whose will they held
their lands, and not far enough removed from the
centre of Anglo-Norman life, to throw off its interests
and lose touch with their connections. Nevertheless
the confusion of authority in South and Mid-Wales
increased considerably as time went on; for
not only did Norman barons marry Welsh heiresses,
but occasionally a Welsh chieftain would win back a
Norman-Welsh lordship by marriage, and present
the anomalous spectacle of a Welshman holding
Welsh land as a direct vassal of the King of England
in entire independence of his district Prince. But
these occasional amenities among the higher aristocracy
but little affected the mass of the Welsh
people, who stood aloof with lowering and uncompromising
sullenness.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Welsh and
Norman.</div>

<p>It was this intolerance of foreigners, bred in the
bone and blood of Welshmen, or this excessive
patriotism, call it what you will, that
made possible their long and heroic resistance
to the Norman yoke, and for so long upheld
the tottering thrones of their not always honest,
and always quarrelsome, Princes. They hugged
their pedigrees and cherished their bards, who in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>39]</a></span>
turn played with tireless energy upon the chords
of national sentiment and martial memories. No
transfer of land to Normans, whether due to the
sword or to more peaceful methods, was regarded as
otherwise than temporary. As in parts of Ireland
at the present day, generations of occupation by an
alien stock commanded no respect beyond what
belonged to the force of ownership. The original
owners might be long extinct in fact, but in the
mind they were the owners still. The Anglo-Saxon
has a short memory; and is practical even in matters
of sentiment. Four or five generations are sufficient
to eliminate the memory of the humble or
alien origin of the <i>parvenu</i>, and are quite enough to
fill his cup of social reverence to the brim; perhaps
fortunately so. The Celt, and particularly the
Welsh Celt, is fashioned differently. With him the
interloper remained an interloper far beyond his
children&rsquo;s children, and this mental attitude had
much to do with the facility with which a popular
leader could at all times stir up strife in Wales,
whatever might be the odds against success.</p>

<p>We have seen, then, the first wedge of alien occupation
driven into this hitherto virgin refuge of the
ancient British stock. For we must remember that,
in spite of continual warfare, the Saxons had made
no impression calling for notice in a brief survey like
this. We must remember, also, that the Norman
settlements were wholly military. The followers
that came with these adventurers were just sufficient
to garrison their castles. They were but handfuls,
and lived within or under the protection of the Norman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>40]</a></span>
fortress: their influence upon the blood of the
country may, I think, be put aside with certain reservations,
as scarcely worth considering.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1105.
Pembroke
and the
Flemings.</div>

<p>The severance of half the present county of Pembroke
from Wales in the reign of Henry the First
must by no means be passed over if one
is to get a proper idea of what was meant
by Wales at the time when this story
opens. It was in this King&rsquo;s reign that a
large body of Flemings were flooded out in the Low
Countries by a great inundation, and despairing of
finding a fresh home in their own crowded fatherland,
they applied to the King of England to allot
them territory out of his presumed abundance.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> In
their appeal the King saw another means of putting
a bridle on the Welsh, at no expense to himself, to
say nothing of the advantage of posing as a philanthropist.
He granted therefore to the Flemings
just so much of the south-western promontory of
Wales as they could hold and conquer, together
with the peninsula of Gower, which juts out from the
coast of modern Glamorgan. Pembroke was the
more important and populous colony of the two.
The native inhabitants, it may be presumed, were
few in the twelfth century; at any rate the Flemings
had no difficulty in driving them inland and forming
a permanent settlement. There was no assimilation
with the natives; they were completely pushed
back, and in a short time Normans came to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>41]</a></span>
assistance of the Flemings. The great castles of
Pembroke, Manorbier, Haverford-west, and Tenby
were built, and speaking broadly the south-western
half of the modern county of Pembroke became as
Teutonic, and in time as English, as Wiltshire or
Suffolk. Continual fighting went on between the native
Welsh and the intruders, keeping alive the animosity
between the two races and laying the seeds
of that remarkable cleavage which makes the county
of Pembroke present to-day an ethnological curiosity
without a parallel in the United Kingdom.</p>

Some accounts say that Henry first received them in England,
but got uneasy at the number which accumulated there and ordered
them all into south-west Wales. Small lodgments of Normans and
other aliens would seem to have preceded the Flemings. <a href="#FNanchor_2_2">Back</a></p>

<p>The Flemings, as English subjects and constantly
reinforced by English arrivals, lost in time their
nationality and their language, and became as thoroughly
Anglo-Saxon as the most fervent Salopian
or the most stolid Wiltshireman. They remain
so, in a great measure, to this very day. Intermixture
with the Celtic and Welsh-speaking part of the
county has been rare. The isolated position of
further Pembrokeshire makes this anomaly still
more peculiar, cut off as it is from England by
nearly a hundred miles of Welsh territory, and
more particularly when the fact is remembered that
for centuries there has been no religious or political
friction to keep these two communities of a remote
countryside apart. Somewhat parallel conditions
in Derry or Donegal, though of much more recent
origin, are far more explicable owing to the civil
strife and religious hatred which are or have been
rife there. Even so the mixture of Scotch-Irish
Protestants with Celtic Catholics has, I fancy, been
much greater in Ireland than that of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>42]</a></span>
Anglo-Fleming Protestants of further Pembroke and of
Gower with their Welsh neighbours of the same
faith &ldquo;beyond the Rubicon&rdquo; in the same counties.</p>

<p>These conquests may, however, be regarded as
constituting for some time the extent of solid Norman
occupation. The story of Wales is one long tale
of continuous attempts by Norman barons on the
territory of the Welsh Princes, varied by the serious
invasions of English Kings, which were undertaken
either directly or indirectly on behalf of their Norman-Welsh
vassals. Upon the whole but slow
headway was made. Anglo-Norman successes and
acquisitions were frequently wiped out, for the time
at any rate, by the unconquerable tenacity of the
Welsh people, while every now and again some
great warrior arose who rolled the whole tide of
alien conquest, save always further Pembroke, back
again pell-mell across the border, and restored Wales,
panting, harried, and bloody, to the limits within
which William the Norman found it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Henry II. and
Owen Gwynedd.</div>

<p>One of these heroic leaders was Owen ap Griffith,
Prince of Gwynedd, who arose in the time of Henry
II. of England. Not only did he clear
North Wales of Normans, but he so ruthlessly
harried Cheshire and the Marches, and so
frightened the Prince of Powys that the latter
joined the Norman-Welsh nobles in a petition
to the King of England begging
him to come up in all haste with a strong
force to their aid. Henry, under whom England
was rapidly recovering strength and cohesion, now
essayed that profitless and thorny path of Welsh
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>43]</a></span>
invasion, which his predecessors, Norman and Saxon,
had so often trodden, and his successors were so
often and so vainly to tread.</p>

Wales, 1166.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Battle of
Crogen.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Henry returns
to England.</div>

<p>He marched with a large army to Chester and, being
there joined by the Prince of Powys and the
Norman-Welsh barons, encamped on Saltney Marsh.
Owen with the forces of North Wales had
come out to meet him as far as Basingwerk,
and as the vanguard of the royal
army advanced against the Welsh through
the wooded defile of Coed Eulo the sons of Owen
fell suddenly upon it, and with great slaughter rolled
it back upon the main force. The King, then taking
the seashore route, made head for Rhuddlan at the
mouth of the Clwyd. But near Flint, in another
narrow pass, he met with even a worse disaster.
For here his vanguard was again attacked, many of
his knights and nobles slain, his standard overthrown,
and he himself in danger of his life. Eventually he
reached Rhuddlan, garrisoned it, came to terms with
Owen, and went home again. But there were two
fierce and uncontrollable Princes now in Wales:
Owen himself, &ldquo;Eryr Eryrod Eryri&rdquo;&mdash;the &ldquo;Eagle of
the Eagles of Snowdon&rdquo;&mdash;and Rhys ap Griffith,
the scarcely less warlike ruler of
South Wales. The period was one of continuous
conflict in Wales and on the border, and it ended
in something like a national movement against
all the centres of Norman power, both royal and
baronial, that were sprinkled over the country.
This was in 1165, and Henry, vowing vengeance, advanced
once more to the Welsh border. He had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>44]</a></span>
learnt wisdom, however, in his former campaign,
and moved cautiously to Rhuddlan in order to
make a preliminary investigation of the
state of affairs. It was evident that nothing
but a great effort would be of any avail;
so returning to England he gathered a large army and
sat down at Chester. In the meantime Owen Gwynedd
as suzerain or Pendragon of Wales, with Rhys,
Prince of Deheubarth, and even the two Princes of
vacillating Powysland, which had recently been split
in half, and in fact with the whole strength of the
Cymry, raised the dragon standard at Corwen
on the Dee. The two armies met
eventually upon the banks of the Ceiriog, just beneath
the hill where the Castle of Chirk, then called
Crogen,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> now lifts its storied towers. The slopes of
the Welsh mountains, even to Snowdon itself, were
in those days sprinkled freely, if not thickly clad,
with timber, and a feature of this expedition was
some two thousand woodcutters employed to open
the country for Henry&rsquo;s army and secure it against
those ambuscades in which the Welsh were so terribly
proficient. But Owen Gwynedd came down
from the Berwyns this time to meet his foe and, as I
have said, a long and fierce battle was waged in the
deep valley of the Ceiriog. The Welsh were in the
end forced to retreat, and recrossing the Berwyn
they took post again at Corwen, and, as tradition has
it, on the lofty British camp at Caer Drewyn on the
north bank of the Dee. Henry followed and sat
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>45]</a></span>
down with his army on the high ridge of the Berwyn,
above Pen-y-pigin, the river flowing through what
was then no doubt a swampy valley between the
two positions. It was the old story, a wearisome
enough one in the long strife between England and
Wales. Henry dared not advance in the face of the
difficult country before him and the Welshmen&rsquo;s
superiority in hill and woodland
fighting. Moreover his provisions had run out, and
to make matters worse the weather broke up, so
there was nothing to be done but to march his great
army home again. The Welsh Princes now attacked
and destroyed many of the King&rsquo;s castles in the
North, and on the border recovered Flint or Tegengle,
which Henry had nominally annexed, and in the
South sorely pressed the Norman barons in Glamorgan,
Brecon, and Gwent. But the old madness of
greed and jealousy which in Welsh Princes seemed
inseparable from success, now took possession of
Rhys and Owen; they turned on their late allies of
Powys, fickle ones, no doubt, and divided their inheritance
between them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Howel ap
Owen Gwynedd.</div>

<p>As for Owen Gwynedd, we must leave him and his
deeds to the fame which, wherever Welshmen congregate,
endures for ever, and pass on to a brief mention
of his son Howel, who has earned immortality
in a curiously different field. Amid the
passions and storms of that fierce age in
Wales, it is strange enough, not to find a
poet-Prince, but to find one singing in such strains
as did Howel ap Owen Gwynedd. Warlike ballads
are readily conceivable in such an atmosphere as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>46]</a></span>
that in which Howel lived, and of war and hunting
he wrote. But he also wrote sonnets, many of which
are extant, to the yellow bloom of the furze, the
blossoms of the apple tree, the laugh of his bright-eyed
sister, to fields of tender trefoil, and to nightingales
singing in privet groves. He shared the fate
of so many Welsh Princes and fell by the dagger,
the assassins being his half-brothers. Both he and
his famous father were buried in Bangor Cathedral.</p>

<p>It may be well to point out that one of the causes
of this chronic strife between the Welsh Princes, besides
the prevalent custom of gavelkind, was that of
fostering out the children of the royal houses; for
when the inevitable struggle for the succession ensued,
each claimant was backed up and vigorously
assisted by the whole interest of the family in which
he had been reared.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Madoc ap

<div class="sidenote">Madoc&rsquo;s colony
in Mexico,

<p>To another son of Owen Gwynedd belongs a tale,
notable in Welsh tradition at any rate, if not in serious
history. Madoc, who had for his portion
the country lying round the western
base of Snowdon, found the struggle for
the possession of it perhaps too wearisome, for he
manned a small fleet and sailed out over the western
seas for many months till he discovered a strange
country, good in all things for the habitation
of man. From this venture, so the
legend runs, Madoc returned, and, collecting
a following of three hundred men in North
Wales, again safely crossed the Atlantic and there
founded, in what is supposed to have been Mexico,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>47]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
a colony of Welshmen, from whom sprang the royal
dynasty of Montezuma.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_4_4" id="Footnote_4_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a>
If this were merely a fairy tale it would certainly be out of place
here; but as regards the Welsh colony it has been considered not
wholly unworthy of the attention of some serious ethnologists.
It may further be remarked, without comment, that a comparatively
modern and (in the vulgar sense) popular short history of Wales treats
the whole story as authentic fact without even a suggestion of any
legendary attributes! There we will leave it. <a href="#FNanchor_4_4">Back</a></p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">Dafydd
ap Owen
Gwynedd,
1170.</div>

<p>Dafydd, the usurping half-brother and murderer
of the poet-Prince Howel, had better luck than he
deserved. King Henry, now bent on making friends
with the Welsh, particularly the North
Welsh as being the most formidable and
homogeneous, gave him in marriage his
sister Emma and with her the rich barony
of Ellesmere. Troops from South Wales were already
helping Henry in Ireland, and now Dafydd
with a large force of his own people crossed to Normandy
to fight the battles of his royal brother-in-law
in that country. It is characteristic of Welsh
politics that while Dafydd was in France, the only
one of his brothers whom he had not killed or imprisoned
took occasion to seize Anglesey and the
four Cantrefs that now make Carnarvonshire.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Giraldus
Cambrensis.</div>

<p>Norman manners and customs seem about this
time to have considerably infected the Welsh aristocracy.
That celebrated ecclesiastic and author,
Giraldus Cambrensis, comes upon the
scene at this close of the twelfth century,
and has much to tell us out of the fulness of his
knowledge of Wales. He was of illustrious birth,
half Welsh, half Norman, and Archdeacon of Hereford,
though his mere office by no means suggests
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>48]</a></span>
his importance, much less the importance he attributed
to himself. It is his entertaining descriptions of
the Welsh life he knew so well that have immortalised
him, and his mixed blood would seem to have
endowed him with the impartiality which he professes.
He was violently opposed among other
things to the encroachments of the Norman Church
in Wales; for the Pope, as I have stated, had now become
recognised as omnipotent, and Canterbury as
the source of all authority. Giraldus strove hard to
get St. David&rsquo;s created an Archbishopric, and to
persuade the Pope to send thither his pallium, the
symbol of consecration. Though it is true he was
himself burning to be installed at St. David&rsquo;s, Giraldus
probably reflected the popular opinion of contemporary
Welshmen in favour of recovering the old
independence of the Welsh Church. The Crusades
were now at their zenith, and Archbishop Baldwin
undertook at this time his famous progress through
Wales on behalf of the holy cause. Giraldus accompanied
him as chaplain, interpreter, and friend
on this protracted tour, and, happily for us, as special
reporter too. The Archbishop&rsquo;s exhortations caused
some passing enthusiasm throughout the country,
though the practical results do not seem to have
been considerable. Some say that Baldwin&rsquo;s main
object was to hold high mass in St. David&rsquo;s Cathedral,
and so put the coping-stone, as it were, on
the annexation of the Welsh Church.</p>

<p>As regards the Crusades the Welsh in the Middle
Ages do not seem to have been great rovers or
much given to doing business on great waters;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>49]</a></span>
always, of course, excepting Madoc ap Owen
Gwynedd, the discoverer of America!</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="sidenote">Giraldus on
the Welsh
people.</div>

<p>&ldquo;These people,&rdquo; says Giraldus, alluding to the Welsh,
&ldquo;are light and active, hardy rather than strong, and
entirely bred up to the use of arms; for not
only the nobles, but all the people are trained
to war, and when the trumpet sounds the husbandman
rushes as eagerly from his plough as the courtier
from his Court. They live more on flesh, milk and cheese
than bread, pay little attention to commerce, shipping,
or manufacture, and devote their leisure to the chase and
martial exercises. They earnestly study the defence of
their country, and their liberty. For these they fight, for
these they undergo hardships, and for these willingly
sacrifice their lives. They esteem it a disgrace to die in
bed, an honour to die on the field of battle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Their arms and their coats of mail,&rdquo; he goes on to
tell us, &ldquo;are light, so also are their helmets, and shields,
and greaves plated with iron. The higher class go to
war on swift and well-bred steeds, but are ready at a
moment&rsquo;s notice, should the nature of the ground require
it, to fight on foot as do the mass of their people.
In times of peace the young men by wandering in the
dense forests and scaling the summits of the highest
mountains inure themselves to the hardships of war
when the necessity arrives.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They were addicted neither to gluttony nor drunkenness,
and could readily go for two days without
food, eating in any case but twice a day. They
could lie out, moreover, all night in rain and storm,
if an enemy had to be watched, or an ambush to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>50]</a></span>
laid. There were whole bands of the better-born
young men whose sole profession was arms, and to
whom free quarters were given upon all occasions.
The Welsh among other things were a clean-shaven
race, reserving only their moustaches, and keeping
the hair of their head short. The teeth of both
sexes too were a special matter of pride. On this
account they even abstained from hot meats, and
rubbed their teeth constantly with green hazel till
they shone like ivory. &ldquo;They have powerful understandings,
being much quicker at their studies than
other Western nations, ready in speech and confident
in expressing themselves, even to the lowest
class.&rdquo; Their love of high birth and long pedigrees
was then as now conspicuous, and the tribal system
though rapidly modifying under Saxon and Norman
influences encouraged them to think much of
their ancestors, and to be quick in avenging insults
to their blood. This custom, indeed, was carried to
such lengths, that the Welshman&rsquo;s tendency to
family quarrels, coupled with his sensitiveness for
the family honour, was neatly satirised by an old
proverb which affirmed that he &ldquo;loved his brother
better dead than alive.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="sidenote">Giraldus on
Welsh warfare.</div>

<p>Giraldus, who may be regarded as a well-informed
neutral in the matter, criticises the injudicious
manner in which war had hitherto been prosecuted
against his countrymen. He deprecates, for instance,
the use of heavy-armed soldiers and a profusion of
cavalry, which the active Welshmen in their mountain
country are easily able to elude and often to
defeat. He declares that the only way to conquer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>51]</a></span>
Wales would be by winter campaigns, when the
leaves are off the trees and the pastures withered.
&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;English troops must
be pushed forward at all hazards, for even
if the first are slaughtered any number of
fresh ones can be purchased for money; whereas the
Welsh are restricted in the number of their men.&rdquo;
The question of commissariat, the crux of all Welsh
campaigns in those days, seems to have escaped the
notice of the clerical critic.</p>

<p>Having thus descanted on their virtues, Giraldus
now assumes the Anglo-Norman on the strength of
his half blood, and enumerates their weak points.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The Welsh are flighty,&rdquo; he tells us, &ldquo;and readily
undertake things which they have not the perseverance
to carry out. They have little respect for oaths, and not
much for the truth, and when a good opportunity occurs
for attacking an enemy they regard neither truces nor
treaties. In war they are very severe in their first attack,
terrible by their clamour and looks, filling the air with
horrid shouts and the deep-toned clangour of very long
trumpets. Bold in the first onset they cannot bear a repulse,
being easily thrown into confusion, as soon as they
turn their backs. Yet though defeated and put to flight
one day, they are ready to resume the combat on the
next, neither dejected by their loss nor by their dishonour;
easier in short to overcome in a single battle, than
in a protracted war. Their great weakness after all,&rdquo;
concludes Gerald, &ldquo;lies in their internal jealousies. If
they were inseparable, they would be insuperable, and
above all, if instead of having three Princes they had
but one, and that a good one!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>52]</a></span>
For their music this invaluable chronicler has nothing
but enthusiasm, dwelling upon the sweetness of
their instruments, the harp and the &ldquo;crwth&rdquo; (a
primitive violin) in particular, and, above all, on their
habit of singing in parts, and not, as most other
nations do, in unison.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Religious
fervour in the
twelfth century.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Abbeys.</div>

<p>However distasteful the aggression of the Roman
Church may have been to the mass of the Welsh
people in the twelfth century, this period
brought a great revival of religious fervour,
even if it came largely from alien sources.
The rude churches of wood or wickerwork
that five and six centuries before had marked the
dawn, not of Christianity, but of organised Christianity,
now gave place to solid and sometimes beautiful
specimens of early English or Norman art. Many
of them, not greatly altered by the restorer&rsquo;s touch,
still stand amid the grandeur of majestic mountains
or the loneliness of surf-beaten shores, and seem in
consequence to speak more eloquently of these far-off,
mysterious times than their more imposing
contemporaries, which are set amid tame and commonplace
surroundings. In the twelfth and thirteenth
centuries, too, the great Welsh abbeys were
in their prime. Valle Crucis, whose graceful ruins
still defy the ages amid the matchless beauties
of the Vale of Llangollen, was the pride
of Powys; Ystradfflur (<i>Strata Florida</i>) in Cardigan
shared with the Cistercian House of Aber Conway
the honour of recording and safeguarding the
chronicles of the Principality and of giving burial to
her most illustrious dead. In a wild Radnor valley
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>53]</a></span>
stood the great Franciscan abbey of Cwm Hir,
while in the green meadows where the silver streams
of the Mawddach and the Wnion meet in the shadow
of Cader Idris, you may yet see the ivy clustering on
the ruins of the once powerful foundation of St.
Illtyd. Some centuries older than any of these,
the most ancient of Welsh abbeys was still intact
upon Ynys Enlli, the remote island of Bardsey, and
served the churches that were so thickly sprinkled
along the rugged coasts of Lleyn. It had been the
&ldquo;Rome of the Cymry.&rdquo; Thousands of pilgrims
had annually turned thither their weary steps. It
was accounted a good thing to go there, and still
better to die there; and though divided from the mainland
by three miles of water, whose tides rage with
notorious violence, the dust of &ldquo;twenty thousand
saints&rdquo; lies, as all good Welshmen know, beneath the
sod of this narrow and stormy isle. These are but a
few haphazard examples of the centres of religion,
which, amid the fierce passions of the Celt and the
restless greed of the Norman, struck at least one
peaceful note in nearly every Cambrian valley.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Powys and
the English
power.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Norman encroachments.</div>

<p>We are now within less than a century of the final
overthrow of Welsh independence. Enough has
been said to show how gradually and with what hard
fighting the disintegration of Wales was brought
about, and still fiercer struggles were yet to come.
The Princes of Powys, though liable to fitful attempts
at independence, had now virtually submitted
to the English King, and even
ranged themselves at times against their
countrymen. North Wales was still intact, always
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>54]</a></span>
excepting that debatable land between the Dee and
Conway, the Perfeddwlad, which was lost and retaken
more times than it would be possible to take
account of here. The great region of South Wales,
however, from the edge of Hereford to Cardigan
Bay, presented a rare confusion of authority. One
scarcely ventures to touch the subject within such
narrow limits as ours must needs be. Hardly as
they were sometimes beset, even to the length of
being driven from their lands and castles, the Norman
adventurers steadily ate up bit by bit the old
Kingdom of Deheubarth. Each man had just so
much territory as he could win by the
sword, and, what was more important,
only so much as he could keep by it. They all
held their lands, whose limits were but vaguely defined
by charter or title-deed, since they were undefinable,
direct from the King of England, and
had by virtue of their office the right to sit in Parliament,
and to support the royal canopy at coronations
with silver spears.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Wales in the
thirteenth
century.</div>

<p>In their own domains they possessed absolute
authority, so far as they could exercise it, even over
the lives of their tenants. Small towns began to
grow under the protection of their castle walls, and
were occupied by their retainers. Courts were
established in each lordship, and justice was administered
to the Anglo-Norman minority after English
custom and to the Welsh majority after the custom
of old Welsh law, and in the native tongue. Let me
repeat, I am but generalising. The condition of
Wales at the opening of the thirteenth century was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>55]</a></span>
far too complex to admit of analytical treatment
within such a brief space as this. The exceptions to
every rule were numerous. The King of
England himself, for example, owned many
lordships and was represented in them by
a Justiciar or Bailiff, and sometimes this functionary
was actually a Welshman. Here and there
again a Welsh noble held property as a Norman
Baron from the King while occasionally a Norman
did allegiance for his barony to a Welsh
Prince, and posed as a Welshman.</p>

<p>The landed system of Wales in the Middle Ages
is still more hopeless for purposes of brief description.
The indigenous tribal system, when land was
held in families, or &ldquo;gwelis,&rdquo; by the descendants
of a privileged though perhaps
a large class, had been steadily undergoing modification
since the later Saxon period,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> and in all
directions it was honeycombed not only by encroaching
Normans, with their feudal and manorial land
laws, and by the monastic houses, but long before
the twelfth century many Welsh princes and chieftains
had felt the Saxon influence, and had drifted
into the manorial system, so far at least as their own
private possessions were concerned.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Llewelyn the
Great, 1195.</div>

<p>With the close of the twelfth century the most
illustrious of all Welsh Princes, the only possible
rival of Glyndwr, Llewelyn ap Iorwerth,
comes upon the scene as a beardless
boy; and in connection with this famous person it
may fairly be said that though there was plenty of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>56]</a></span>
fight left in the still unconquered moiety of South
Wales, and a little even in Powys, it is with Gwynedd
that the interest of the last century of Welsh resistance
mainly rests. Son of Iorwerth the broken-nosed,
who, though the rightful heir of Owen
Gwynedd, was rejected on account of this disfigurement,
Llewelyn the Great is supposed with good
reason to have been born in the castle of Dolwyddelan,
whose ruinous walls, perched high upon the
wild foot-hills of Moel Siabod, still look down
upon the infant Llugwy as it urges its buoyant
streams through one of the most beautiful of North
Welsh valleys.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Llewelyn

<p>Nurtured amid the clash of arms, the boy was only
twelve years old when he asserted his right to the

in France. The young Prince, backed by a
strong following in North Wales, and by the arms of
Powys, deposed his uncle and commenced the long
career which earned him that pre-eminent fame in
warlike deeds which attaches to his name. By the
time he was of age he was fully recognised as
&ldquo;Brenin holl Cymru,&rdquo; or Pendragon, by all that was
left of Wales. John, who now occupied the English
throne, so fully recognised the dawn of a
new and formidable personal influence in
his tributary realm that he bestowed upon
Llewelyn in marriage his illegitimate
daughter Joan, together with a handsome dower.</p>

<p>The first few years of the thirteenth century were
fully occupied with ceaseless strife between the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>57]</a></span>
Welsh Princes, their relatives, and the Norman nobles
settled in their midst. It will be sufficient to
say that Llewelyn, high-handed and autocratic, lost
nothing of his importance in such congenial work,
and by 1209 had left his mark upon the English
borders so rudely that King John and his vigorous
son-in-law at length came to blows. The former,
collecting a large army, penetrated to the Conway
River, behind which, in the mountains of Snowdonia,
Llewelyn with all his people and all his
movables defied attack.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Llewelyn

<p>John, with whom went many of the nobles of
Powys, sat down at Deganwy Castle, one of the
great strategic points of ancient Wales,
and one whose scanty ruins are familiar
to visitors at Llandudno and Conway. But the
Welsh slipped behind them and cut off their supplies.
Nor could the King move forward, for
across the river rose the grim masses of the Snowdon
mountains. His people were reduced to eating
their horses, disease was ravaging their ranks,
and there was nothing for it but to go back; so
John returned to England with rage at his heart.
Nothing daunted he returned again to the attack,
marching this time by way of Oswestry and Corwen.
He was now both more daring and more fortunate,
seeing that he succeeded in throwing a portion of
his forces into Bangor. This checkmated Llewelyn,
and he sent his wife to see what terms
could be exacted from her father. His
reply indicated that the cession of the unfortunate
Perfeddwlad, and a fine of twenty thousand head of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>58]</a></span>
cattle was the least he could accept, and with these
terms the Welsh Prince complied. The latter condition
was probably inconvenient; the former was
merely a question of might for the time being. Any
territorial arrangement with John was likely to be
of only temporary consequence, for that undesirable
King was perpetually under the ban of the Church,
and had none too many friends. So in 1212, when
Pope Innocent absolved all John&rsquo;s feudatories from
their allegiance, it furnished an admirable
excuse for Llewelyn to reoccupy the whole
of his ancient dominion of Gwynedd.
When, two years later, John&rsquo;s own barons
rose against him, they formed an alliance with the
powerful Prince of Gwynedd, who captured Shrewsbury,
and thereby contributed no little to the pressure
which caused the signing of Magna Charta.</p>

<p>Llewelyn subsequently swept through both Mid-&nbsp;and
South Wales, sacking and gutting many of the
hated Norman castles, till he came to be regarded in
the South with as much devotion as in his own
province. Every dispute concerning territory or
boundaries was submitted to his judgment. Even
the Flemings of Pembroke for the first time since
their occupation tendered their homage to a Welsh
Prince.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Llewelyn

<div class="sidenote">Llewelyn&rsquo;s

<p>But between the death of John and the accession
of Henry III., the nobles of England forgot their
obligations to Llewelyn, while the Marcher barons
whose castles he had sacked were eager enough to
turn this indifference into hostility. The result of
all this was that Llewelyn found himself threatened
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>59]</a></span>
by the whole power of England and of Anglo-Norman
Wales in the event of his refusal to
abandon his recent conquests. Llewelyn
ap Iorwerth, wise in his generation, sought
a personal interview with the young King,
his brother-in-law, at which he undertook to do him
homage; a formality which, I have more than once
observed, Welsh Princes had no reluctance upon
principle in conceding. On this occasion, moreover,
Llewelyn&rsquo;s pride was fully gratified. He was officially
recognised as Prince of all Gwynedd, with the
second title of Lord of Snowdon, and his suzerainty
over the other divisions of Wales was formally acknowledged.
We find him emphasising this diplomatic
triumph by granting that bone of contention,
the Perfeddwlad, to his son Griffith, and the latter
with the fatuity so common to his race returning
this piece of parental affection by laying violent
hands on Merioneth, another district within his
father&rsquo;s Principality. This was a wholly outrageous
proceeding and Llewelyn, finding remonstrance unavailing,
hastened eastward with a strong force to
chastise his incorrigible offspring. The
latter was quite prepared to fight, and we
have the edifying picture of father and
son facing each other in arms in a cause wholly
wanton, and as if there were no such thing as Normans
and Saxons, to say nothing of South Welshmen,
ever and always threatening their existence.
A reconciliation was happily effected, but when
Llewelyn found himself with most of the soldiery
of his province around him in arms, the temptation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>60]</a></span>
was too great, and throwing treaties to the winds,
he fell upon the English border and harried it from
Chester to Hereford. Drawn thence south-westwards
by signs of restlessness on the part of that
ever-rankling sore, the Anglo-Flemish colony of
Pembroke, he swept through South Wales and
fought a great battle on the confines of their territory,
which the fall of night found still undecided.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Continuous
war, 1234.</div>

<p>From now onwards till 1234 there was little peace
in Wales, and above the ceaseless din of arms the
star of Llewelyn ap Iorwerth shone with
ever increasing glory. Then came a confederation
of Norman barons against King Henry,
who, turning for support to Llewelyn, entered into a
solemn league and covenant both with him and
with his tributary princes. It was so strong a combination
that Henry shrank from coping with it. It
was the first occasion on which Anglo-Norman
Barons and Welsh Princes on an important scale had
formed a treaty of alliance with each other and, still
more, had honourably observed it. Even more singular
perhaps was the outcome, when, Henry being
forced to a compromise, a Welsh Prince found himself
in the unprecedented position of being able to
exact conditions for the great Norman feudatories of
Wales from a Norman King.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Death of
Llewelyn II.,
1240.</div>

<p>Llewelyn, having buried his wife Joan in the abbey
of Llanfaes near Beaumaris, himself died at Aber in
the year 1240, after a stormy but, judged
by the ethics of the time, a brilliant reign
of over half a century. His triumphs were
of course for the most part military ones. But no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>61]</a></span>
Welsh Princes having regard to the decline of Cymric
power had ever accomplished quite so much. He
had forced his authority upon all Wales except the
lordship Marches, but he had also been a sleepless
patriot, driving the English arms back and greatly
weakening the English influence throughout the
whole Principality. With this scant notice of a long
and eventful reign we must take leave of the warlike
son of Iorwerth. He was buried at Aber Conway
in the abbey he had founded; but his stone
coffin was removed in later days to the beautiful
church at Llanrwst, where amid the historic treasures
of the Gwydir Chapel it still recalls to the
memory of innumerable pilgrims &ldquo;the eagle of men,
who loved not to lie nor sleep, who towered above
the rest of men with his long red lance and his red
helmet of battle crested with a savage wolf, Llewelyn
the Great.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="sidenote">Griffith sent
to the Tower
by Henry III.</div>

<p>Wales, though rapidly approaching the era of her
political extinction, was now so unusually strong and
even aggressive that the English King was compelled
to watch the course of events there with a
vigilant eye. From the Welsh point of view it was
of vital importance that Llewelyn&rsquo;s successor in
Gwynedd should be both acceptable to his people
and strong in himself. Unhappily he was neither,
unless indeed obstinacy may count for strength. Of
Llewelyn&rsquo;s family two sons alone concern us here.
Griffith, the elder of these by a Welsh mother, has
been already alluded to as going to war in such wild
fashion with his father. Rightly or wrongly he was
regarded as illegitimate, though that circumstance, it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>62]</a></span>
may be remarked parenthetically, was not such a
vital matter in Old Wales. But his father&rsquo;s marriage
with an English King&rsquo;s daughter suggests the possibility
of making too light of a former and less distinguished
alliance. Be that as it may, the younger
of the two, the son of the Princess Joan and nephew
of Henry III., succeeded in seating himself on his
father&rsquo;s throne, though not without protest from the
Welsh nobility who did not by any means relish his
English blood. Dafydd had all the English influence
behind him, while his close connection with the
King seemed to make for peace. But Griffith, the
elder, in spite of his presumed illegitimacy, was the
popular candidate, and Dafydd did not improve
his own position by proceeding to strip his half-brother
of his private property, and immuring his
person in Criccieth Castle. All Wales protested.
The Bishop of Bangor went so far as to excommunicate
his temporal ruler, and King Henry himself on
his distant throne expressed unmistakable disapproval
of the whole business. But Dafydd cared
neither for King nor Bishop. To the former he replied
that if Griffith were at liberty there would be
no peace in Wales, a possibility that seems by no
means remote when one considers the performances
of this young man in his father&rsquo;s lifetime. Henry was
not to be thus put off, and approached the Marches
with a strong army. This unmistakable procedure
and the almost unanimous support it met
with from the Welsh nobility frightened
Dafydd into a promise of submission. But
the upshot of all this was not precisely what Griffith&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>63]</a></span>
Welsh friends had expected. He was released
from Criccieth, it is true, but only to be transferred
to the Tower of London pending Henry&rsquo;s decision
as to his ultimate fate.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Death of
Griffith.</div>

<p>Much more important than this disposal of Griffith&rsquo;s
person was the extraction from Dafydd by his
uncle of one of the most humiliating treaties ever
wrung from a Welsh Prince, a treaty which might
well cause his father, the great Llewelyn, to turn in
his grave beside the Conway. Every advantage that
Llewelyn&rsquo;s strong arm had gained was tamely abandoned
by his unworthy son. The Princes of Powys
and South Wales were absolved from their oath of
homage to the ruler of Gwynedd, which Principality
shrank once more to the banks of the Conway. In
the meantime Griffith with his young son Owen was
left by Henry to languish in the Tower, till, filled with
despair, he made a bold bid for freedom. Weaving
ropes out of his bed-clothing he let himself
down by night from his prison window;
but, being a corpulent man, his weight was too much
for such slender supports, and he fell from a great
height to the ground, breaking his neck upon the
spot.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1244.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Henry III.
in Wales.</div>

<p>The Welsh were greatly exasperated at the news,
laying the death of their favourite most naturally at
Henry&rsquo;s door, and as the Marcher barons had been
encouraged of late in their aggressions and tyrannies
by the decline of Welsh strength, the time seemed
ripe for another general rising. Dafydd now came
out as a warrior and a patriot leader, and Wales rallied
to his standard. He was, however, so appalled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>64]</a></span>
by the memory of the awful oaths of allegiance he
had sworn to his royal uncle and the vengeance of
Heaven he had invited in case of their non-observance,
that he sent secretly a sum of money
to the Pope,&mdash;all in fact he could scrape
together,&mdash;begging for absolution. His
Holiness granted this readily enough and
professed to recognise his right to independence.
But Henry, hearing of it, and disturbed by these
man&oelig;uvres of the Vicar of God, secretly forwarded
twice the amount of money sent by Dafydd to the
Pope, who thereupon reversed all his previous decisions.
We do not hear whether the Welsh Prince
got his money back. He certainly got no value for
it. So now in these years of 1244-45 war
raged once more throughout Wales and
the Marches, and Dafydd, though unendowed with
his father&rsquo;s warlike talents, nevertheless by his patriotic
action regained the affection of his people.
Henry was busy in Scotland and it was nearly a year
before he could get to Wales in person; when he did,
he pushed his way, with only one brisk fight, to that
time-honoured barrier, the Conway estuary, and sat
down with a large army of English and Gascons on
the green pastures around Deganwy Castle, where he
gazed with inevitable helplessness at the Welsh
forces crowding on the marsh across the river,
or lining the outer ramparts of Snowdonia that
frown behind it. The troubles of King
John, and even worse, befell his son.
Matthew of Paris has preserved for us a &ldquo;letter from
the front&rdquo; written by a knight, who gives a graphic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>65]</a></span>
description of the sufferings of the army, not forgetting
himself in the narration of them. Cold,
sickness, and hunger were their lot, varied by fierce
skirmishes with the Welsh and desperate fights over
the English provision boats, which made their way
from Chester round the Orme&rsquo;s Head into the Conway.
Aber Conway Abbey was ruthlessly sacked
by the English soldiery, much to the regret, it should
be said, of our &ldquo;special correspondent&rdquo; and greatly
to the rage of the Welsh, who in revenge slaughtered
every wounded Englishman they could lay hands on.</p>

<p>No definite result accrued from this war. Dafydd
died a few months after this amid the regrets of his
people, whose affection had been secured by his later
deeds. He had atoned for his former pusillanimity
by the stubborn resistance which marked the close of
his life. His death made way for the last and, to
Englishmen, the most illustrious of all the long line
of Welsh Princes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sons of
Griffith

N. Wales.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Henry III.
again in
Wales.</div>

<p>Dafydd left no heir. Strictly speaking, his legal
successor was a Norman, Sir Ralph Mortimer, who
had married Gwladys, a legitimate daughter of
Llewelyn. Such a successor was of course out of the
question, and, as Henry abstained from all interference,
the nobles of North Wales naturally fell back
on the illegitimate branch, that of Griffith, who
perished in the moat of the Tower of London. This
unfortunate Prince, whose body was about this time
removed to Conway and buried with great pomp,
had three sons, Llewelyn, Owen, and Dafydd. It
would seem as if all past experiences were lost upon
the nobles of Gwynedd, since they were fatuous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>66]</a></span>
enough to appoint the two elder of these Princes to
the joint rulership of their province. The partnership
survived an English invasion which Henry
made on hearing that the chieftains of
South Wales were calling on the new
Princes of Gwynedd to aid them, in the belief
that a diversion would be opportune.
Once more the English appeared on the Conway.
As usual, the Welsh with their stock and movables
had slipped over the river into the impregnable
wilds of Snowdonia, and the King returned as
he went, burning St. Asaph&rsquo;s Cathedral
on his march. There was now peace in
Wales for some years; a lull, as it were, before
the great conflict that was to be the end of all
things. But peace and plenty, in the words of the
chronicler, &ldquo;begat war.&rdquo; For want of enemies the
two brothers turned their arms against each other.
Owen, the younger, was the aggressor in this instance,
and he justly suffered for it, being overcome by
Llewelyn and immured for the rest of his life in the
lonely castle of Dolbadarn, whose ivy-mantled shell
still stands by the Llanberis lakes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Llewelyn III.
(or ap
Griffith).</div>

<div class="sidenote">1257-58.</div>

<p>Dafydd, the third brother, had supported Owen,
and he, too, was seized and securely confined. Llewelyn,
now supreme in North Wales, becomes
the outstanding figure around
which the closing scene of the long and
heroic resistance of the Welsh henceforth gathers.
South Wales was in a distracted state. The Lord
Marchers and the King&rsquo;s Bailiffs, backed by English
support, had taken fresh heart from Welsh dissensions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>67]</a></span>
and were pressing hardly on those native chieftains
who did not side with them. Every chieftain and
noble in Wales whose patriotism had not been tampered
with now took up arms. Llewelyn was universally
recognised as the national leader, and the
years 1257-58 were one long turmoil of
war and battle in every part of Wales.
Llewelyn had cleared off all recent aggression, fallen
with heavy hand on the old settled barons, and smitten
the traitors among his fellow-countrymen hip
and thigh. A battle was fought on the Towy, which
some chroniclers say was the bloodiest ever engaged
in between Welsh and English, to the worsting of
the latter and the loss of two thousand men.</p>

<div class="sidenote">King Henry
attacks
Llewelyn.</div>

<p>The Perfeddwlad had been granted to Prince Edward,
then Earl of Chester. His agents there had
distinguished themselves, even in those
cruel times, for intolerable oppression.
Llewelyn in his vengeance swept Edward&rsquo;s
new property bare from the Conway to the
Dee. The future conqueror and organiser of Wales
was at this moment hardly pressed. His Welsh
friends, like the then Prince of Powys, were heavily
punished by Llewelyn and their lands laid waste.
Edward sent to Ireland for succour, but the Irish
ships were met at sea by those of Llewelyn and
driven back. Henry now returned to his son&rsquo;s
assistance, and, drawing together &ldquo;the whole strength
of England from St. Michael&rsquo;s Mount to the river
Tweed,&rdquo; executed the familiar promenade across the
wasted Perfeddwlad, and experienced the familiar
sense of impotence upon the Conway with its well
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>68]</a></span>
defended forts and frowning mountains alive with
agile spearmen.</p>

<p>Once again the tide of battle rolled back to the
English border, and the first serious punishment we
hear of the Welsh receiving curiously enough was at
the hands of some German cavalry imported and led
by Lord Audley, whose large horses seem to have
struck some terror into the mountaineers. But this
is a detail. Llewelyn may almost be said to have repeated
the exploits of his grandfather and reconquered
Wales. Even Flemish Pembroke had been
forced to its knees. His followers to the number of
ten thousand had bound themselves by oath to die
rather than submit, and these, being picked men and
inured to war, were a formidable nucleus for the
fighting strength of Wales to rally round. The revolt,
too, of Simon de Montfort against Henry was all
in favour of Llewelyn, who took the former&rsquo;s part
and was able to render him considerable personal
service in the decline of his success.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1267. Llewelyn
makes
peace and is

Henry as
Prince of all
Wales.</div>

<p>Through many years of intermittent strife and
varying fortunes the balance of power remained with
Llewelyn, till in 1267 a peace was made
at Shrewsbury very greatly in his favour.
By this agreement Henry in consideration
of a sum of money undertook to recognise
Llewelyn as Prince of all Wales and
entitled to receive homage and fealty
from every prince and noble in the country save the
sadly shorn representatives of the old line of Deheubarth.
But after two years&rsquo; enjoyment of this contract
the King&rsquo;s death and the succession of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>69]</a></span>
strenuous Prince Edward threw everything once
more into confusion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Llewelyn
and Edward
I., 1275.</div>

<p>It is true that Edward, who was in the Holy Land
fighting Turks, took two years in finding his way
home. But when he did so, in 1274, and
was crowned King he threw his father&rsquo;s
treaty with Llewelyn to the winds; an
action for which, it is true, the latter gave him some
excuse by refusing to attend at his coronation, not
from recusancy, but from a well-grounded fear that
his life would not be safe from certain Anglo-Norman
nobles whose territory he would have to pass through.</p>


<div class="break">
<div class="sidenote">Llewelyn&rsquo;s

</div>

<p>Now comes a passage in Llewelyn&rsquo;s stormy life
that his admirers would fain forget, since it records
how for love of a woman he reversed the indomitable
front he had hitherto shown to the invading
English, and submitted almost without a blow to
the dictation of the returned Crusader, whom he had
so often beaten of old in the Welsh Marches. It
was perhaps the memory of these former rebuffs that
made the proud and warlike Edward so vindictive
towards Llewelyn. A weapon, too, was at this moment
placed in his hands which was to assist him
in a manner he had not dreamed of. The young
daughter of the late Simon de Montfort, to whom
the Welsh Prince was betrothed and whom
he is said to have deeply loved, was sailing
from France to become his bride. In
anxiety to escape the English, the ship
that bore her unluckily ran among some Bristol vessels
off the Scilly Islands. The captains seized
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>70]</a></span>
the prospective bride and carried her at once to
Edward, who was on the point of invading Wales
with two armies. Four years of peace had doubtless
weakened the strong Welsh league that had
worked such wonders against Henry III. Numbers
of his old friends at any rate failed to respond to
Llewelyn&rsquo;s call. The Prince had now before him
the alternatives of immediate union with his betrothed,
or of war and chaos with a lukewarm or
hostile South Wales and certainly a hostile Powys
added to the power of England.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Llewelyn
makes peace
with Edward
I.</div>

<p>After being cooped up for some weeks in the
Snowdon mountains by the royal army, Llewelyn
signed at length a treaty with Edward, the conditions
of which were as humiliating as if he had
been crushed to the earth by a series of disastrous
battles, whereas he was in truth the still recognised
suzerain of all Wales. To put the case, or the gist of
it, briefly: all Wales except the Snowdon lordships
(the present Carnarvonshire) was to revert absolutely
to the King of England, Welsh and alien lords alike
becoming his tenants. Even Anglesey was to revert
to the Crown in the event of Llewelyn&rsquo;s dying without
issue. Nothing was to be left of Welsh independence
but the &ldquo;cantrefs,&rdquo; or lordships,
constituting Snowdonia; and over this
remnant Llewelyn&rsquo;s heirs were to be
graciously permitted to reign in peace.
The Prince&rsquo;s passion had proved greater than his
patriotism; the treaty was signed at Conway, and
King Edward, who had advanced unopposed to
Cardiganshire, withdrew his troops.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>71]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Llewelyn&rsquo;s
marriage.</div>

<p>&ldquo;The force of love,&rdquo; says the chronicler, groaning
over this depressing episode, &ldquo;does indeed work
wonders.&rdquo; Llewelyn, not long afterwards,
was married in great pomp at Worcester
in presence of the whole Court of England, the
King himself giving the bride away, and the late
ruler of all Wales and now lord merely of Snowdonia,
with a life interest in Anglesey, retired to the
obscurity of his contracted honours. Here, amid
the Carnarvon mountains, he began ere long to feel
the prickings of conscience, and remorse for the
weak part he had played.</p>

<p>Edward, too, kept open the wound by frequently
summoning him to this place or that on various
pleas, and the Welsh Prince, dreading treachery and
remembering his father, Griffith&rsquo;s, fate, as constantly
refused to go without a guaranty of safety. The
greater part of the present counties of Carmarthen
and Cardigan were already King&rsquo;s ground. As
forming part of the old Principality of South Wales,
and therefore not Marcher property, they had come
to Edward. A county court had before this been
established at Carmarthen, and efforts to make
this territory shire ground had been feebly made, but
they were now vigorously renewed, and the Perfeddwlad
was treated in savage fashion. Ferocity was the
distinguishing mark of all the servants of Edward I.</p>

<p>From every part of Wales came the cry of despairing
Welshmen ground to powder by the
insensate tyrannies of the King&rsquo;s Bailiffs
and the Lord Marchers, now left entirely
to their own wild wills. Llewelyn&rsquo;s third brother,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>72]</a></span>
Dafydd, who had played the part of King&rsquo;s friend
and traitor to his own people for most of his
life, was rewarded by the Barony of Denbigh. It
was the year 1281 and the time was now ripe for the
last scene of the last act in this long, sanguinary
struggle. Many of the chieftains of Wales, thinking,
as they had often thought before, that death was
preferable to the intolerable oppression from which
the country now suffered, approached Dafydd at
Denbigh and assured him that if he would even thus
tardily be reconciled to his brother Llewelyn and
lead them, they would strike yet one more blow for
freedom. Dafydd, probably with their
knowledge, was smarting under some
real or fancied slight from his patron, King Edward,
though maybe his heart was really touched
at the extreme sufferings of his countrymen. At
any rate he played the man to an extent that more
than atoned for his unworthy past. Dafydd and his
brother Llewelyn now met at the former&rsquo;s castle
upon the high rock of Denbigh, and there the Welsh
chieftains who had declared for death or freedom
rallied to the standard raised by the grandsons of
Llewelyn the Great, and held upon &ldquo;the
craggy hill in Rhos&rdquo; the last formal council
of either peace or war that was to be
recorded in the pages of Welsh history. The news
of the proposed rising had reached England before
Llewelyn had left his palace at Aber, and had caused
some consternation. Edward and his barons had regarded
the Welsh question as settled, and thought
that on the death of the now pacified and uxorious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>73]</a></span>
Llewelyn the last vestige of independence would
quietly lapse. The Archbishop of Canterbury was
greatly distressed. He sent word to Llewelyn that he
was coming to see him for the love he bore to Wales,
and without the King&rsquo;s knowledge; and he then, in
actual fact, travelled all the way to Aber and used
every argument, persuasive and coercive, he could
think of to turn the Welsh Prince from what seemed
a mad and hopeless enterprise. He threatened him
with the whole physical power of England, the whole
spiritual power of Rome. Never did the last Llewelyn,
or indeed any Llewelyn, show a nobler front
than on this occasion. For himself, he was materially
well provided for and beyond the reach of the
persecution that pressed upon most of his fellow-countrymen.
But they had called to him in their
despair, and desperate as the risk might be he had
resolved to stand or fall with them. A schedule of
conditions was sent him from the English King and
his council, under which everything was to be overlooked,
if only he and his people would return to
their allegiance. Among other things an English
county, with a pension of &pound;1000 a year,
was offered him in lieu of Snowdon.
Llewelyn replied with scorn that he wanted no
English county, that his patrimony was lawfully his
own by virtue of a long line of ancestors; that even
if he himself were base enough to yield up the Snowdon
lordships, his subjects there would never submit
to a rule that was hateful to them and had brought
such misery on their neighbours of the Perfeddwlad.
It was better, he declared, to die with honour than to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>74]</a></span>
live in slavery; and it may perhaps be repeated to
his advantage that Llewelyn himself was only a sufferer
so far as his proper pride was concerned, though
it is possible he felt some pricks of conscience about
the concessions made two years previously. At
any rate he nobly atoned for them. There is evidence
that admiration for the gallant
stand made by this remnant of the Welsh
was being kindled not only across the seas
but even among Englishmen themselves. &ldquo;Even
Englishmen and foreigners,&rdquo; says Matthew of Paris,
who was assuredly no Welshman, &ldquo;were touched
with pity and admiration.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="sidenote">Dafydd rejects
Edward&rsquo;s
terms.</div>

<p>Prince Dafydd, who was offered his pardon on condition
of immediately repairing to the Holy Land,
was equally stubborn, though perhaps the
temptation to be otherwise was not so
great. He replied to the effect that he
had no intention of undertaking a Crusade at the
dictates of others. However admirable was this tardy
patriotism, his past record from that point of view
was wholly dishonourable, for he had been consistently
a King&rsquo;s man. On the other hand, if, as was
possibly the case with many Welsh nobles, he had
sincerely believed that submission to English rule
was the wisest thing for Welshmen, his abrupt repudiation
of the man whose favours he had sought
and received is not readily excusable. In this direction
it is urged that the Anglo-Norman garrisons in
these first years of Edward&rsquo;s reign had made life so
intolerable that Dafydd was sufficiently touched by
his countrymen&rsquo;s sufferings to risk everything and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>75]</a></span>
join his gallant brother in so forlorn a hope. &ldquo;It
was better for the kingdom at large that Wales
should be governed,&rdquo; wrote the brothers to Edward,
&ldquo;by her own Princes, paying that homage to the
King of England which they had never refused,
than by greedy strangers whose only thought was
to oppress her people, despoil her churches, and
advance their own private interests.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fighting on
the Menai
Straits.</div>

<p>The fall of the curtain upon this remnant of
Welsh independence was now but a matter of a few
months. Edward&rsquo;s answer to the Princes was the
despatch of a fleet to Anglesey, and of an army
along the north coast route, containing large numbers
of Gascons, and even some Spaniards. Edward
himself went as far as Conway, meeting on the way
with a heavy repulse and considerable loss in what
was soon to be Flintshire. Dafydd, who was commanding
in the north, was pushed into Snowdonia.
The English army in Anglesey bridged the Menai
with boats, and a strong detachment, crossing before
the connection was complete, encountered
the Welsh near Bangor. The invaders,
however, were all cut off and slain in
a fierce battle fought upon the shore, among them
being many barons, knights, and squires.</p>

<p>These successes could only delay the end and exasperate
the inevitable conquerors. Llewelyn, not
wishing to be starved into surrender among the
Snowdon mountains, had gone south to rouse the
new shire land of Cardigan and Carmarthen, and
the warlike Radnor tenants of the Mortimers. The
Earl of Gloucester with another English army had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>76]</a></span>
meanwhile penetrated into South Wales and defeated
a large force of Welsh patriots at Llandilo in
the valley of the Towy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Death of
the last
Llewelyn.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Llewelyn&rsquo;s
head carried
through
London in
triumph.</div>

<p>Llewelyn came up, fighting his way through Cardiganshire,
and had reached Builth on the Wye,
when, on December 11th, he met his fate.
The story of his death is too much confused,
and there is no space here for repeating
the slightly varying versions of the tragedy,
but it seems quite clear that he was tempted away
from the main body of his army by treachery, and
slain when he was without arms in his hands. His
head was struck off and despatched at once to King
Edward at Conway, who, receiving it with great joy,
sent it immediately by sea to his army in Anglesey.
Thence the gruesome trophy was forwarded to London,
where crowds of people met it outside the city
and placed upon the gory brows a wreath of ivy in
mockery of the old Welsh prophecy that a Prince of
Welsh blood should once more be crowned
in London. It was then fixed upon the
point of a lance and carried in triumph
through the streets to the pillory, and
from the pillory to its final resting-place above the
gate of the Tower.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Capture and
execution
of Dafydd.</div>

<p>Thus perished the last representative of the long
line of Welsh Princes that may be said to have had
its rise with the sons of Cunedda eight centuries before.
The last dim spark of Welsh independence
flickered feebly for a few weeks, till the very recesses
of Snowdonia, for almost the first time in history,
gave back their echoes to the blast of English bugles,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>77]</a></span>
and the wild passes of Nant Francon and Llanberis
felt the tramp of alien feet. Dafydd found himself
alone, a hunted outlaw in the forests of the Vale of
Clwyd. He was soon captured and taken
to Shrewsbury, where a Parliament was
then sitting. Llewelyn&rsquo;s remains had
been treated with doubtful logic and poor chivalry
as a traitor. What treatment he would have met
with at Edward&rsquo;s hands as a prisoner we cannot
know. But Dafydd could expect nothing but the
worst and he received it. He was tried as an English
baron at Shrewsbury and sentenced to be quartered,
disembowelled, and beheaded. His quarters
were distributed among four English cities, Winchester
and York, it is said, quarrelling for the honour of
his right shoulder, while his head was sent to moulder
by his brother&rsquo;s over the gateway of the Tower of
London. A story runs that while his entrails were
being burned his heart leaped from the flames and
struck the executioner who was feeding them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1282.
Edward
settles the
new government
of
Wales.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The Statutes
of Rhuddlan.</div>

<p>All resistance worthy of mention was now over in
Wales. The six centuries or thereabouts of its history
as a separate nation in whole or in
part had closed. A new epoch was to
open, and Edward was the man to mark
the division between the past and the
future in emphatic fashion. Hitherto,
though statesmanlike in his views, he had been in
actual deed both cruel and unjust to Wales, and
allowed his agents to be still more so; but now
that resistance was crushed he dropped the warrior
and tyrant and showed himself the statesman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>78]</a></span>
that he was. Most of the Welshmen that had remained
in arms received their pardons, though a
few took service abroad. The King exacted no sanguinary
vengeance, but followed, rather, the more
merciful and practical course of providing against
the chance of his Welsh subjects requiring it in
future. He went to Wales with his Court and remained
there for nearly three years. He made
Rhuddlan his principal headquarters, rebuilding its
ancient castle; and at Conway, Harlech, and Carnarvon,
besides some less formidable fortresses, he
left those masterpieces of defensive construction
that have been the admiration of all subsequent
ages. From Rhuddlan in due course he issued
the famous statutes called by its name,
which proclaimed at once the death-knell
of Old Wales and the fact of its territorial fusion
with the realm of England. The details of the settlement
were laborious, and the spectacle of an English
Court spending in all nearly three busy years in
Wales is evidence of the thoroughness with which
Edward did his work.</p>

<p>It is enough here to say that with the exception
of modern Denbighshire, which was left in lordships,
Edward carved North Wales into the present counties
of Flint, Anglesey, Carnarvon, and Merioneth.
Powys and South Wales being honeycombed with
Anglo-Norman lordships and reconciled Welsh chieftains,
he shrank probably from disentangling a confusion
that brought no particular danger to himself,
and from a course that would have embroiled him
with the whole feudal interest of the Marches.</p>

The still mainly Welsh districts, however, of Cardigan
and Carmarthen, he had already, as we have
seen, formed into counties. They were now, like
those of the North, to be governed by lieutenants,
sheriffs, and justices, and in all things to resemble
English counties, except in the privilege of
sending representatives to Parliament. Wales was
kept separate from England, however, in so far as
its immediate feudal lord was not the King of England,
but the King&rsquo;s eldest son; and the Principality
of Wales at this time, it must be remembered, meant
only the royal counties.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Edward&rsquo;s intentions
just.</div>

<p>Edward&rsquo;s laws for the conquered country were
just and his intention not ungenerous. He reduced
the rentals hitherto due to the Welsh
Princes and listened patiently to the grievances
of the people. He enacted that both in counties
and lordships the old Welsh laws should be those
of the Welsh so far as possible, and that justice
should be administered in both languages, and he
sent the Archbishop of Canterbury on a long visitation
to take note of the destruction to churches
perpetrated during the recent wars, and to arrange
for their repair.</p>

<p>He was severe on the bards, it is true, but he did
not slaughter them, as an old fiction asserts. Their
wandering avocations were sternly repressed, and
with the business that he had in hand it is not easy
to see what other course he could have taken with
men whose trade then chiefly consisted in recalling
the wrongs of Wales and urging revenge. The
whole business was concluded by a great tournament
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>80]</a></span>
at Nevin, on the Carnarvon coast, which was attended
by the flower of Welsh, English, and Gascon chivalry.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The King&rsquo;s
return to
London.</div>

<p>When the King returned to London after his long
absence, he went with splendid ceremonial and a
vast procession to the Tower and to Westminster
Abbey, causing the regalia of the
exterminated Welsh Princes and the skull
of St. David to be borne before him. Nor must one
omit mention of the immortal but grim joke which
tradition says that he played upon the Welsh nobility
before leaving the country. For does not every
schoolboy know how, having promised them a Prince
who was born in Wales and could speak no English,
he sent Queen Eleanor to Carnarvon for the birth
of Edward the Second?</p>

<div class="sidenote">1295.</div>

<p>A good deal can be said of the century that
was to elapse before our story opens, but not much
that is of vital import. In 1295, thirteen
years after the conquest, Madoc ap Meredith,
a connection of Llewelyn&rsquo;s, made a last attempt
to rouse the Welsh. It proved abortive, but
was serious enough to stop Edward from going to
France, and to take him down to Conway, where it
is said that on a certain occasion a high tide cut
him off from his men, and nearly delivered him into
the hands of the insurgents.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Wales
through the
fourteenth
century.</div>

<p>It would be too much to say that the next hundred
years in Wales were those of peace and
prosperity. But by comparison with the
past they might not untruly be called so.
No serious friction occurred between the
two races; while the long wars with France and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>81]</a></span>
constant broils with Scotland engrossed the attention
of the Welsh aristocracy, both Norman and
native. Nor, again, was it only the nobles and gentry
that found respite from their domestic quarrels
in a combined activity upon the unfortunate soil of
France. Welsh soldiers as well as Welsh gentlemen
served by thousands in the armies of England, and
few people remember that about a third of the victorious
army at Cressy were Welshmen. This long
companionship in arms and partnership in almost
unparallelled glories must have done something to
lessen the instinctive antipathy with which the two
peoples had from time immemorial regarded each
other. Yet how much of the ancient enmity survived,
only requiring some spark to kindle it, will be
evident enough as I proceed to the main part of
my story, and the doings of the indomitable Welshman
who is its hero.</p>

rings true enough in the lines of the great poet,
and is even shorn of some of the most fearsome details
it has sent down to us through various channels.
Shakespeare&rsquo;s Glyndwr might, for instance, have told
us, what all Welshmen of his day were well assured
of, that on that memorable night the horses of
Griffith Vychan, his father, were found standing in
their stables up to their fetlocks in blood; and how

</div>

<p>There is great uncertainty as to the day, and some
disagreement as to the exact year, wherein old earth
thus shook in labour with so heroic a soul. This
divergency of opinion extends over the period of ten
years, from 1349 to 1359. The evidence that seems
to give the latter date unquestionable preference will
be alluded to shortly. In any case the point to be
noted is that the hero of this story, judged by the
standard of his time, was quite advanced in life when
he began the long and arduous undertaking that has
made his name immortal, and cherished by his
countrymen as the most famous of all names in their
history. For there is no shadow of a doubt that if
the Welsh people were polled upon the subject,
Owen Glyndwr would stand, by an overwhelming
majority, at the head of the list of national heroes.
Whether rightly or wrongly he holds the first place
among Welsh warrior patriots in the affections of
his countrymen.</p>

<p>It was the fortune, as I have endeavoured to make
plain in the introductory chapter, of a long succession
of Welsh chieftains, to find themselves at the
head of a people struggling desperately against conquest
and absorption. It is no wonder that with such
opportunities ever present, century after century,
the list of those who seized them and won distinction
and some measure of success, and thereby preserved
their names to posterity, is no short one. It is not
to the point that the field of their exploits was a
small one, and the people who cherish their memory
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>84]</a></span>
a small people,&mdash;so much more, rather, the honour,
seeing the odds against which they contended with
such rare tenacity; nor, again, is it to their discredit
that English historians have done as a rule scant
justice to the vigour of the old Welsh warriors.
&ldquo;Good wine needs no bush.&rdquo; The surface and the
tongue of Wales to-day are sufficient evidence to the
vitality of its people and their martial prowess in
the days of old. Their heroes have happily too long
been dust to suffer in reputation at the hands of the
modern destroyer of historic ideals. But above them
all, this last and most recent of patriots, Owen ap
Griffith Vychan of Glyndyfrdwy, distinctly towers.
Precisely why this should be is not readily explicable,
and to very many educated Welshmen the fact is
not acceptable. But it is unnecessary to advance
here any reasons or theories for the particular preference
accorded to Glyndwr. Whether worthy or not,
the fame is his, and though, curiously enough, uncommemorated
in marble, stone, or brass, and recorded
by the poet and historian in a fragmentary
and disconnected fashion, it is fame that seems to
grow no dimmer with the lapse of time. Genealogy
has charms for few people, and Welsh genealogy, to
the Saxon who has not served some kind of apprenticeship
to it, is notoriously formidable. But there
will be Welsh readers of an assuredly more sympathetic
turn of mind who, not having at their fingers&rsquo;
ends, perhaps, the details of the national hero&rsquo;s
origin, will be not ungrateful for them.</p>

<p>Owen of Glyndyfrdwy, commonly called Owen
Glyndwr, came of the princely house of Powys, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>85]</a></span>
was a direct descendant in the male line of the celebrated
Bleddyn ap Cynvyn, Prince of Powys, and
for a short time of Gwynedd also, whose reign almost
exactly covered the period of the Norman
conquest of England. The second in descent from
Bleddyn was the last Prince of United Powys,
and this was Madoc ap Meredith, who died in 1159.
Readers of the introductory chapter will remember
that Powys, between the upper millstone of Norman
power and the nether one of North Welsh patriotism,
began to temporise and give way long before the
Edwardian conquest. Its Princes would have been
more than mortal if their politics had not been of
an unsteady kind. They frankly accepted the Norman
as &ldquo;Emperor in London&rdquo; somewhat early,
thus accepting the inevitable, but could not resist
the temptation when Welsh affairs were prospering
to break away to the national side. While gaining
at this cost some immunity from Norman greed and
a measure of semi-independence, the Powys Princes
were not wholly trusted by either party, and sometimes
felt the vengeance of both. In 1159 Powysland
fell in half; Powys Uchaf, or, roughly speaking,
Montgomeryshire, being given to Madoc&rsquo;s famous
nephew, Owen Cyfeiliog, warrior, poet, founder of
Strata Marcella Abbey, and author of <i>The Hirl&acirc;s
Horn</i>; Lower Powys, or Powys Fadog, the country
of the Dee and Ceiriog, fell to Madoc&rsquo;s son, Griffith
ap Madoc. This last was followed by another
Madoc, who in 1200 founded the splendid Abbey of
Valle Crucis, whose ruins, standing as they do in the
loveliest nook of the Vale of Llangollen, are justly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>86]</a></span>
celebrated as presenting one of the most exquisite
pictures of the kind in Britain. Beneath its grass-grown
aisles lies the dust of the chieftain of this
line of Powys. To a height of eight hundred feet
above its crumbled walls and gables, still graceful in
their decay, springs an isolated cone-shaped hill, on
whose sharp crown stands a pile of ragged, splintered
ruins placed in weird, suggestive fashion against
a background of sky. This is Dinas Br&acirc;n, the most
proudly perched medi&aelig;val fortress in Wales, perhaps
in all Britain. Here in this eagle&rsquo;s nest, swung betwixt
earth and heaven, lived the Princes of Powys
Fadog; and no more fitting refuge could be imagined
for men who, like them, had sometimes to
look eastward for their foes and sometimes to the
west. It was in 1270, close to the final conquest,
that Madoc&rsquo;s son Griffith died, after dividing his life
between friendship with the English King and
repentant alliances with his own race. He had
married Emma, daughter of James, Lord Audley,
who had done great service for Henry III. against
the Welsh with a body of German cavalry. The
death of this Griffith ap Madoc is the last event
recorded in the Welsh Chronicle. It is supposed
that the monks of Conway and Ystradfflur, who
conjointly compiled it, could not bring themselves
to put on record the sad events of the next twelve
years, the last years of Welsh independence. Griffith&rsquo;s
son, another Madoc, followed, and died in
seven years, leaving two young sons, and dividing
his inheritance between them. The elder, Llewelyn,
had Dinas Br&acirc;n with Yale and Bromfield,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>87]</a></span>
while Griffith had Chirk and the territory attached
to it. The orphan boys, their father having been
tenant <i>in capite</i> of Edward the First, became that
monarch&rsquo;s wards. Edward, as was customary, handed
them over to the guardianship of two of his nobles,
selecting in this case the great Marcher barons, Warren
and Roger Mortimer. Trusteeships were not in
those days, even under favourable conditions, the
thankless and unprofitable affairs they are now.
Warren had Llewelyn and Dinas Br&acirc;n; Roger Mortimer,
Griffith and Chirk. A Welsh ward in the hands
of a Norman Lord Marcher must have been a lamb
among wolves indeed; and as every one, no doubt,
expected, under conditions so painfully tempting,
the two boys in due course disappeared and were no
more seen, while two magnificent castles arose at
Chirk and Holt respectively, with a view to securing
to these unjust stewards their ill-gotten territory. A
black tale, which posterity has accepted, crept steadily
about, to the effect that a deep pool in the Dee beneath
Holt Castle could tell of a midnight tragedy
therein enacted. The two boys at any rate disappeared,
and the Earls, according to custom, succeeded
to their estates. Nor is it very likely that
the King, who himself had a slice of them in that
outlying fragment of Flint still conspicuous on the
map of England, asked many questions.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 409px;">
<a name="holt" id="holt"></a>
<img src="images/og07.jpg" width="409" height="600" alt="" />
<p class="caption">HOLT CASTLE.<br />
<br />
<small>FROM OLD PRINT.</small></p>
</div>

<p>It seems that such conscience as Earl Warren possessed
was smitten with compunction as years went
on, and these twinges he thought to allay by restoring
a fragment of the property to the family he had
so outraged. When the King was sitting at Rhuddlan
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>88]</a></span>
in 1282 the remorseful Earl petitioned that the
manors of Glyndyfrdwy on the Dee beyond Llangollen
and of Cynllaeth a few miles to the south of
it, should be restored to Griffith, an uncle of the two
boys whose fate weighed, let us hope, upon his soul.</p>

<p>In this manner Griffith succeeded to these estates
and was known as Y Baron Gwyn, or &ldquo;the White
Baron,&rdquo; Lord of Glyndyfrdwy in Yale, dying about
1300. Fourth in direct descent from him and occupying
the same position was Owen Glyndwr&rsquo;s father,
Griffith Vychan (<i>i. e.</i>, &ldquo;the little&rdquo; or &ldquo;the younger&rdquo;),
the preceding owner having been a Griffith too. To
him succeeded Owen, as eldest son, holding his two
manors, like his fathers before him, direct from the
King. On his mother&rsquo;s side Owen&rsquo;s descent was
quite as distinguished,&mdash;even more so if one is to
believe that his mother, Elen, was a great-granddaughter
of Catherine, the daughter of the last
Llewelyn. Putting this aside, however, as mere
tradition, it will be enough to say that Griffith
Vychan&rsquo;s wife came from South Wales and was a
daughter of Thomas ap Llewelyn ap Rhys, a descendant
of the Princes of Deheubarth, Lord of Iscoede
Vchirwen in Cardigan and of Trefgarn in the parish
of Brawdy, Pembrokeshire. He had two daughters,
co-heiresses, the elder of whom, Elen, married Owen&rsquo;s
father, while the younger became the wife of Tudor
ap Gronow of Penmynydd, the grandfather of the
famous Owen Tudor. It will be seen, therefore,
that Thomas ap Llewelyn was the ancestor both of
Glyndwr and of our present King.</p>

<p>Owen was actually born in the South Welsh home
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>89]</a></span>
of his mother&rsquo;s family and inherited property from
her which no doubt added to his wealth and consequence.
Trefgarn Owen, Trefgarn West (or &ldquo;<i>castel</i>&rdquo;),
still exists as a farmhouse, and the tradition that
Owen was born in it is likely long to outlast the edifice
itself. This event occurred probably in the year
1359, in the heyday of the successful wars in France,
so that it is quite possible that Griffith Vychan may
have been among the crowd of Welsh gentlemen
who followed the banners of Edward the Black
Prince across the Channel. This would quite account
for the presence of Owen&rsquo;s mother at such a
time in the home of her fathers; and as we know
nothing of his childhood, it is perhaps permissible to
indulge in conjectures that have about them some
reasonable probability.</p>

<p>Of Owen&rsquo;s early manhood and domestic life, however,
quite enough is known to dissipate the notion
engendered by Shakespeare, and but faintly discouraged
by English historians, that he was a wild Welsh
chieftain, a sort of picturesque mountaineer. On the
contrary, he was a man accustomed to courts and
camps, and, judged by the standard of his time, an
educated and polished gentleman. The first actual
record we have of him is on September 3, 1386,
when he gave evidence at Chester as a witness in the
greatest and most prolonged lawsuit that had ever,
in England, filled the public eye. This was the celebrated
case of Scrope and Grosvenor, the point in
dispute relating solely to a coat of arms. It lasted
four years and nearly every prominent person in
the country at one time or another gave evidence.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>90]</a></span>
Among these appears the name of &ldquo;<i>Oweyn Sire de
Glendore de age XXVII ans et pluis</i>,&rdquo; also that of
&ldquo;<i>Tudor de Glindore</i>,&rdquo; his brother, who was some three
years younger than Owen, and fell ultimately in his
service. Of the nature of his evidence we know
nothing. The entry is only valuable as giving weight
to the year 1359 as the most likely date of his birth.</p>

<p>In the social economy of Wales, Owen&rsquo;s forbears,
since they lost at the Edwardian conquest, in the
manner related, the chieftainship of Powys Fadog,
had been simply minor barons or private gentlemen
of fair estate. They had nothing like the official
position, the wealth, or the power of the Lord
Marchers. Still they owed no allegiance, as did many
of the lesser nobility, to any great Marcher baron,
but held their estates in North Wales direct from the
King himself. And we may well suppose that with
the long memories of the Welsh no Marcher baron,
no Mortimer, nor Gray, nor Talbot, whether in peace
or war, was in their eyes so great a man as simple
Owen of Glyndyfrdwy, on whose modest patrimony
the vast estates of these interlopers encroached. As,
in the ancient tribal laws of Wales, it took nine generations
for an alien or servile family to qualify for
admission to full rights, so it was equally difficult to
make a medieval Welshman realise that the ejected
landowners and princes of their own race were other
than temporary sufferers. They could not believe
that Providence intended to perpetuate so great an
outrage. They recognised in their hearts no other
owner but the old stock, whatever the exigencies of
the times might compel them to do with their lips,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>91]</a></span>
and even their spears and bows, while every vagrant
bard and minstrel helped to fix the sentiment more
firmly in their breasts.</p>

<p>Owen himself, as a man of the world, had, of course,
no such delusions. No one, however, when the time
was ripe, knew better than he how to work upon the
feelings of those who had. A family grievance of
his own, as we have shown, he might justifiably have
nursed, but there is no reason to suppose that he
was on bad terms with the houses either of Warren
or Mortimer. Indeed, he is said to have been esquire
at one time to the Earl of Arundel. His local
quarrels lay, as we shall see, to the north and rested
wholly on personal grounds, having no relation
whatever to the wrongs of his great-great-grandfather.</p>

<p>In the only signature extant of Owen previous to
his assumption of princely honours, we find him
describing himself as &ldquo;Oweyn ap Griffith, Dominus
de Glyn D&rsquo;wfrdwy.&rdquo; To dwell upon the innumerable
ways in which his name and title were spelt by Norman
and Celtic writers, contemporary and otherwise,
in times when writers&rsquo; pens vaguely followed their
ears, would be, of course, absurd. The somewhat
formidable sounding name of Glyndyfrdwy simply
means the Glen of the Dwfrdwy or Dyfrdwy, which
in turn is the original and still the Welsh name for
the river Dee. About the first syllable of this word
philologists have no scope for disagreement, &ldquo;Dwr&rdquo;
or &ldquo;Dwfr&rdquo; signifying water; but concerning the terminal
syllable there is room for some difference of
opinion. It will be sufficient for us here to say that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>92]</a></span>
the derivations which seem to the eye most obvious
are not so much in favour as that from &ldquo;Diw,&rdquo;
sacred or divine. This attribute at any rate has been
bestowed on the chief and most beautiful of North
Welsh rivers by English and Welsh poets from
Spenser to Tennyson and, according to the former,
&ldquo;by Britons long ygone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In regard, however, to the pronunciation of the
name of Owen&rsquo;s patrimony, when I have said that
the very natives of the historic hamlet slur the name
into something like Glyndowdy,&mdash;a rare luxury
among the Welsh,&mdash;it is not surprising that Anglo-Norman
chroniclers and others have made havoc of
it with their phonetic spelling. Even Welsh writers
have been unsteady upon the point. And Owen of
Glyndyfrdwy probably figures under more designations
than any hero who ever lived: Glendour,
Glindor, Glindore, Glendurdy, Glyndurdu, and Glendowerdy,
are but a few selected specimens.</p>

<p>English historians, with characteristic contempt of
Welsh detail, have selected the last and the most unlikely
of them all. In his own country Owen was
generally known during his later life and ever since
his death as Glyndwr, the spelling to which I have adhered
in these pages. It may perhaps not be out of
place to note that the Welsh &ldquo;w&rdquo; is equivalent to a
&ldquo;&#333;&#333;,&rdquo; and by a Welsh tongue the terminal &ldquo;r&rdquo; is,
of course, strongly marked.</p>

</div>

<p>Of the early youth of Glyndwr history tells us
nothing, nor, again, is it known what age he had
reached when his father died and the estate came
into his possession. It is supposed that like so many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>93]</a></span>
Welshmen of his time he went to Oxford; but this,
after all, must be mere surmise, though, judging by
the bent of his life at that period, we seem to have
good grounds for it. In such case it is likely
enough that he took a leading part in the ferocious
faction fights with which the jealousies of English,
Welsh, and Irish students so often enlivened the
cramped streets of medieval Oxford. It is quite
certain, however, that Owen went to London and became
a student of the Inns of Court, a course virtually
confined in those times to the sons of the
wealthy and well-born. There is something very
natural in the desire of a large Welsh landowner of
that time to familiarise himself with English law,
for the two codes, Welsh and English, to say nothing
of compromises between them, existed side by
side over nearly all Wales, and one can well understand
the importance of some knowledge of Anglo-Norman
jurisprudence to a leading Welshman like
Glyndwr, who must have had much to do, both
directly and indirectly, with both kinds of courts.
That he was no wild Welsh squire has been already
shown, and it was not unnatural that a youth of
handsome person, high lineage, and good estate
should drift, when his law studies were completed,
into the profession of arms and to the English Court.
Here he soon found considerable favour and in course
of time became squire of the body, or &ldquo;scutiger,&rdquo; not,
as most Welsh authorities have persisted, and still
persist, to King Richard the Second, but to his
cousin of Bolingbroke, the future Henry the Fourth.
This latter view is certainly supported by the only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>94]</a></span>
documentary evidence extant, as Mr. Wylie in his
able and exhaustive history of that monarch points
out. &ldquo;Regi moderno ante susceptum regnum,&rdquo; is the
sentence in the <i>Annales</i> describing Glyndwr&rsquo;s position
in this matter, and it surely removes any doubt
that Bolingbroke is the King alluded to. In such
case Owen must have shared those perils and adventures
by land and sea in which the restless Henry
engaged. It is strange enough, too, that men linked
together in a relationship so intimate should have
spent the last fifteen years of their lives in a struggle
so persistent and so memorable as did these two.
Bolingbroke began this series of adventures soon after
the loss of his wife, about the year 1390, and we may
therefore, with a fair probability of truth, picture
Glyndwr at that grand tournament at Calais where
Henry so distinguished himself, and poor Richard by
comparison showed to such small advantage. He
may also have been present at the capture of Tunis,
where English and French to the wonder of all
men fought side by side without friction or jealousy;
or again with Bolingbroke on his long journey in
1393 to Jerusalem, or rather towards it, for he never
got there. There were adventures, too, which Owen
may have shared, with German knights upon the
Baltic, and last, though by no means least, with
Sigismund, King of Hungary, at that memorable
scene upon the Danube when he was forced into his
ships by the victorious Turks.</p>

<p>Yet the tradition is so strong that Glyndwr was in
the personal service of Richard during the close of
that unfortunate monarch&rsquo;s reign, that one hesitates
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>95]</a></span>
to brush it aside from mere lack of written evidence.
Nor indeed does the fact of his having been Henry&rsquo;s
esquire constitute any valid reason for doing so.
It is not very likely that, when the latter in 1398 was
so unjustly banished by Richard to an uneventful
sojourn in France, Glyndwr, with the cares of a family
and estate growing upon him, would have been eager
to share his exile. On the other hand, he must have
been by that time well known to Richard, and with
his Pembrokeshire property and connections may
well, like so many Welshmen, have been tempted
later on to embark in that ill-fated Irish expedition
which promised plunder and glory, but turned out
to be incidentally the cause of Richard&rsquo;s undoing.
That this feckless monarch possessed some peculiar
charm and a capacity for endearing individuals to
his person seems tolerably evident, however strange.
That the Welsh were devoted to him we know, so
that perhaps the loyalty to Richard with which most
Welsh writers credit Glyndwr arose from such personal
service rendered after the departure of Bolingbroke
for France. And it is quite possible that he
went, as they assert, with the King on that last
ill-timed campaign which cost him his crown.</p>

<p>Some declare that he was among the small knot of
faithful followers who, when his army abandoned
the slothful Richard on his return to Pembrokeshire
from Ireland, rode across country with him to Conway,
where Salisbury in despair had just been compelled
to disband his freshly mustered Welshmen for
lack of food and pay. If this is true, Glyndwr, who
most certainly never lost battles from sloth or timidity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>96]</a></span>
when he became in one sense a king, must have
witnessed with much sympathy the lamentations of
the faithful Salisbury:</p>

<div class="cpoem27">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;O, call back yesterday, bid time return,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thou shalt have ten thousand fighting men;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To-day, to-day, unhappy day too late,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O&rsquo;erthrows thy joys, friends, fortune, and thy state.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>All this occurred in September of the year 1399.
Henry, taking advantage of Richard&rsquo;s absence, had
landed, it will be remembered, at Ravenspur in Yorkshire
some two months earlier. He found discontent
with the existing state of affairs everywhere
prevalent and the recognised heir to the throne but
lately dead. The situation was tempting to a degree.
Bolingbroke&rsquo;s first intention had almost certainly
aimed at nothing more than the recovery of his own
immense estates of which he had been most unjustly
and unscrupulously deprived by his royal
cousin. But unexpected temptations confronted
him. He was met on landing by the Percys and
soon afterwards by other great nobles, who, from
what motives it matters little, encouraged him to
seize the throne. To make a short story of a famous
episode in English history, Bolingbroke found himself
by September, when Richard was returning with
fatal tardiness from Ireland, not indeed actually
crowned, but in full possession of London and other
districts and virtually acknowledged as King. In
the same month he was heading a triumphant march
by way of Bristol at the head of a great and gathering
army towards North Wales, where Richard lay, as we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>97]</a></span>
have seen, at Conway, helplessly wringing his hands
and cursing the fate he had brought upon himself.</p>

</div>

<p>According to the Welsh version, Glyndwr must
have been present when Percy, Earl of Northumberland,
who in years to come was to be so vitally bound
up with his fortunes, entered the great hall of Conway
Castle, to all appearances a friendly and unarmed
envoy of Henry of Bolingbroke. We all
remember his soft speech and how with the utmost
deference and humility he told King Richard that all
his dear cousin required of him was to ride back by
his side to London and there summon a Parliament,
and bring to justice certain persons, who, for the past
few years, had been his evil counsellors. If Glyndwr
was in truth there, he must almost certainly have
seen these two illustrious personages commit that
astounding piece of perjury and sacrilege in Conway
church, when they knelt side by side and swore before
the altar and upon the sacred elements that
their intentions towards each other were wholly
friendly and without guile. He must then, too,
have heard King Richard, when scarcely off his
knees, swear that if only he could get his dear cousin
of Bolingbroke into his hands he would put him to
such a cruel death it should be long spoken of even
in Turkey. Perhaps it was the memory of the spectacle
that decided Glyndwr on certain occasions in
his after life to show a curious reluctance to &ldquo;put his
trust in princes,&rdquo; however loyal in the abstract he
might be to their memory. If we follow the Welsh
tradition, he saw this game of duplicity to the bitter
end and made one of the small band of horsemen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>98]</a></span>
who crossed the estuary of the Conway in the dawn
of an autumn morning with the puling king on
their way to Rhuddlan Castle, whose ivy-mantled
ruins still make such a charming picture amid the
meadows where the Clwyd winds its tidal course
towards the sea. Long before Richard got there, and
while still surmounting the steep headland of Rhos
above Old Colwyn, he caught sight of the troops
which the crafty Northumberland had left there in
concealment. It was too late to retreat. The
waves roared far beneath him and rocky crags towered
high above his head. He saw that he was undone
and read in the situation the black treachery he
would have himself dealt out with scant scruple to
anyone lingering in the path of self-indulgence,
which he had so long trodden.</p>

<div class="cpoem21">

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Amid faces from which the friendly mask had
already half fallen and spears that may well have had
an ominous glitter in his eyes, the disheartened King
passed on to Rhuddlan and from Rhuddlan to the
strong castle of Flint. Here in the morning came
to him his cousin of Bolingbroke, inquiring, among
other things, whether he had broken his fast, for he
had a long ride before him. Whereat Richard demanded
what great army was that which darkened
the sands of Dee below the castle walls. Henry
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>99]</a></span>
replied curtly that they were Londoners for the most
part, and that they had come to take him prisoner to
the Tower, and nothing else would satisfy them. If
Glyndwr were indeed present it must have been a
strange enough sight for him, this meeting of his
former patron and his present master, under such
sinister circumstances, in the gloomy chambers of
Flint Castle. If he were still here it may be safely
assumed that, like the rest of Richard&rsquo;s escort, he
went no farther. Even if he were absent, quietly
hawking and hunting at Glyndyfrdwy, there would
be nothing irrelevant in calling to the reader&rsquo;s recollection
a famous episode, the chief actors in which
had so far-reaching an influence on the Welsh hero&rsquo;s
life; how all semblance of respect for the King&rsquo;s
person was dropped; how, mounted of design upon a
sorry nag, he was led with many indignities along the
weary road to London and there made to read his
own abdication in favour of his captor and cousin;
and how he was hurried from fortress to fortress,
till at Pontefract he ended his misspent life in a manner
that to this day remains a mystery&mdash;all this is
a matter of historic notoriety. Whether the unfortunate
Richard died of grief, failing health, and lack
of attention, or whether he was the victim of deliberate
foul play, only concerns us here from the fact
of his name occurring so frequently in our story as a
rallying-cry for Henry&rsquo;s enemies, and from the mystery
attaching to the manner of his death being for
years a genuine grievance among the rank and file of
the disaffected, and a handy weapon for their more
designing leaders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>100]</a></span>
How much of his life Glyndwr had so far spent
in his native valleys of the Dee or Cynllaeth it is
impossible to guess. Perhaps at odd times a good
deal of it; seeing that he was now over forty, had
found time to marry a wife, a lady of the neighbourhood,
by whom he had become the father of a numerous
family, and to win for himself great popularity
and a name for hospitality. The famous Welsh poet,
Gryffydd Llwyd, much better known by his bardic
name of &ldquo;Iolo Goch,&rdquo; or the Red Iolo, was his constant
friend and companion at this time, and became,
later on, the Laureate of his Court and of his cause.
In the thick volume which the extant works of Iolo
fill he has left us a graphic though somewhat fantastic
picture of Glyndwr&rsquo;s domestic life. I have already
shown how the Welsh chieftain owned the two
estates of Glyndyfrdwy and Sycherth or Cynllaeth in
his native district, while from his mother he inherited
property in Pembroke. The two former places were
near together. If the mountain fringes of Glyndyfrdwy,
which ran east and west, did not actually
touch the Sycherth estate, which ran north and
south with the waters of the Cynllaeth brook, there
could have been little but the deep Vale of the
Ceiriog to divide them. There were mansions upon
both estates, and, though Glyndyfrdwy was the more
important property, it was in the less striking but
still charming valley down which the Cynllaeth babbles
to meet the Tanat beneath the woodlands of
Llangedwyn, that Sycherth or Sychnant, the more
imposing of Glyndwr&rsquo;s two houses, was situated.
This valley lies snugly tucked away behind the first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>101]</a></span>
ridge of hills which rises abruptly behind Oswestry
and so conspicuously marks the Welsh frontier. It
practically skirts the English border, and Offa&rsquo;s Dyke
trails its still obvious course along the lofty summit
of its eastern boundary. Scarcely anywhere, indeed,
does the Principality begin in a social sense with
such striking abruptness. Once over the hill from
Shropshire, and within a short hour&rsquo;s drive from
Oswestry, and you are for every practical purpose in
the heart of Celtic Wales. Few travellers come this
way, for it is on the road to nowhere that the outside
world takes count of, and few strangers but an
occasional antiquary ever see the well-defined and
flat-topped tumulus on which the manor house of
the most famous of all Welshmen stood. It lies in
a meadow between a wooded hill and the Cynllaeth
brook, not far from Llansilin, and is very conspicuous
from the road leading up the valley to the little
hamlet, whose churchyard holds the dust of another
famous Welshman, the seventeenth-century poet,
Huw Morris. The inner and the outer moat of
Sycherth are still more or less perfect, and there are
even yet, or were not long ago, plain traces of stonework
beneath the turf. It will be well, however, to
let Iolo, who was there so much and knew it so well,
tell us what it looked like in his time, five hundred
years ago.</p>

<p>There was a gate-house, he says, a strong tower,
and a moat. The house contained nine halls, each
furnished with a wardrobe filled with the raiment of
Owen&rsquo;s retainers. Near the house on a verdant bank
was a wooden building supported upon posts and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>102]</a></span>
roofed with tiles. Here were eight apartments in
which the guests slept. There was a church, too, in
the form of a cross, and several chapels. The mansion
was surrounded with every convenience and every
essential for maintaining a profuse hospitality:
a park, warren and pigeon-house, mill, orchards, and
vineyard; a fish-pond well stocked with &ldquo;gwyniads&rdquo;
from Bala Lake, a heronry, and plenty of game of all
sorts. The cook, Iolo declares with much enthusiasm,
was one of the very best; and the hospitality
of the establishment so unstinted that the office of
gate porter was a sinecure. Our bard indeed makes
his poetic lips literally smack over the good things
beneath which Glyndwr&rsquo;s table groaned. Nor does
he forget his hostess:</p>

<div class="cpoem21">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;The best of wives,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Happy am I in her wine and metheglyn;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Her children come forward two by two,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A beautiful nest of chieftains.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Charming, however, as is the site of Sycherth, nestling
beneath its wooded hill and looking out towards
the great masses of the Berwyn Mountains, it would
ill compare with that almost matchless gem of Welsh
scenery, where the vales of Edeyrnion and Llangollen
meet among the mantling woodlands and sounding
gorges of Glyndyfrdwy. It is a curiously apt
coincidence that one of the most romantic spots in
Wales should have been the cradle of the man who
is without doubt the most romantic personage in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>103]</a></span>
Welsh history. Scarcely anyone, as I have said,
ever finds his way to Sycherth; but thousands of
travellers every summer follow by road or rail that
delightful route which, hugging the Dee from Ruabon
almost to its source beyond Bala Lake, reveals
new beauties at every turn. Such being the
case I would venture to ask any intending traveller
from Ruabon to Bala and Dolgelly to take special
note of a spot just five minutes to the westward of
Glyndyfrdwy station, where the wide torrent of the
Dee, after clinging to the railroad for some distance,
takes a sudden bend to the north. Precisely here,
but perched high upon the other side of the railroad
and so nearly overhanging it as not to be readily visible,
is a green tumulus crowned by a group of windswept
fir trees. This is locally known as &ldquo;Glyndwr&rsquo;s
Mount,&rdquo; not because, as was probably the case at
Sycherth, it was erected as a foundation for the
chieftain&rsquo;s house,&mdash;since this one here is evidently
prehistoric,&mdash;but merely from the fact that the house
stood at its foot. Vague traces of the house are still
visible beneath the turf of the narrow meadow that
lies squeezed in between the Holyhead Road on the
upper side and the river and railroad on the lower
side.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Whether Sycherth was Owen&rsquo;s favourite home
in peace or not, Glyndyfrdwy was most certainly his
more natural headquarters in war, while in his own
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>104]</a></span>
district. Both, however, were burnt down by Prince
Henry, as we shall see later on, in one of his expeditions
against the Welsh. As for the mound, it is a
notable landmark, being one of a series which are
sprinkled along the Dee valley in such fashion as to
indicate beyond a doubt that if they were indeed
the tombs of dead warriors, they were also most admirable
signal-stations for living ones. But whatever
the origin of this one it had at any rate no
connection with times so recent as those of Glyndwr.
The only surviving relic of that hero&rsquo;s residence is a
long, narrow oaken table of prodigious thickness,
which is yet treasured in a neighbouring farmhouse.
A meadow below is still called &ldquo;Parliament field,&rdquo;
while the massive old stone homestead of Pen-y-bont,
half a mile up the valley, contains a portion of the
walls which formed, it is believed, Glyndwr&rsquo;s stables,
or, more probably, his farm buildings. But as many
of these local points will come up in the course of
my story, it is time to say something of the lady
who, so entirely blest in her earlier years, was to
spend her later ones amid such stress and storm, and
to share so precarious a crown.</p>

A friend of the writer, who lived to an advanced age, was told in
his youth by old men in the neighbourhood that they could remember
when there was a good deal of stonework to be seen lying about.
Now, however, there is little to mark the spot but the suggestive undulations
of the turf. <a href="#FNanchor_6_6">Back</a></p>
</div>

<p>This lady bountiful of Sycherth and Glyndyfrdwy,
so extolled by Iolo, came of a notable Flintshire
house. She was the daughter of Sir David Hanmer
of Hanmer, a family long settled in that detached
fragment of Flint known then as Maelor Seisnig, or
&ldquo;English Maelor.&rdquo; Sir David had been appointed by
Richard the Second one of the Justices of the King&rsquo;s
Bench and at the same time knighted. There are
Hanmers even yet in those parts; till comparatively
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>105]</a></span>
lately there were still Hanmers of Hanmer. More
enduring than a human stock, there are monuments in
stone and brass that tell the story, common enough
in England, of a family that for centuries were great
in their own district without ever making their name
a familiar one to the average British ear. The Hanmers,
too, were a fair specimen of many families in
the Welsh Marches who had both English and Welsh
blood in their veins, and whose sympathies were divided
when social animosities took a warlike turn.
It was very much so indeed with the Hanmers when
Glyndwr&rsquo;s war by degrees forced everyone to take
a side in self-defence. Of Glyndwr&rsquo;s sons only two
are directly mentioned, Griffith and Meredith, both
of whom we shall find fighting by his side, but at
such an advanced stage of the struggle that it seems
probable they were but boys when hostilities broke
out. We hear dimly of three more, Madoc, Thomas,
and John. Of the daughters somewhat more is
known; and they must for the most part have been
older, since it seems that three were married before
the troubles began. The eldest, Isabel, became the
wife of a Welshman, Adda ab Iorwerth Ddu. The
second, Elizabeth, married Sir John Scudamore of
Kent Church and Holme Lacy in Herefordshire,
whose descendants still retain the name and the first
of these historic manors. Another, Janet, was given
to John Crofts of Croft Castle in the same county,
and the youngest, Margaret, called after her mother,
took another Herefordshire gentleman, Roger Monnington
of Monnington. The most celebrated was
the fourth daughter, Jane, whom we shall find being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>106]</a></span>
united under romantic circumstances to her father&rsquo;s
illustrious captive and subsequent ally, Sir Edmund
Mortimer. She it is, of course, whom Shakespeare
brings upon his stage and, in her song to Hotspur
and Mortimer,</p>

<p>The Commote of Glyndyfrdwy, which formed
Owen&rsquo;s Dee property, lay in the then newly formed
county of Merioneth, though it was wedged in by
the Marcher lordships of Chirk, Bromfield, and Yale
on the east; while to the north, Denbighshire as yet
having no existence, it touched the Norman lordships
of Ruthin and Denbigh in the Vale of Clwyd.
But Glyndwr held his estates direct from the King,
having manor courts of his own, and resorting in
more important matters to the assize towns of Dolgelly
and Harlech. Corwen must have been actually
on his property but, though a notable gathering-spot
in war time, it had no corporate existence, and was
probably even more insignificant in size than the
other Merioneth towns. The Welsh did not herd
together in towns or villages. Each individual or
group of individuals dwelt on their small homesteads
scattered about the hillsides or cut out of the forests
which then covered so much of the country and had
contributed so greatly to its defence.</p>


<p class="break">Owen in his home life must have been something
of an unique personality. He was the equal in breeding
and in knowledge of the world of the great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>107]</a></span>
barons around him,&mdash;the Greys, Talbots, and Charltons,&mdash;and
of sufficient estate to be himself a grand
seigneur. Yet his hospitable house must have offered
a remarkable contrast in the eyes of the natives to
the grim fortresses of Chirk, or Dinas Br&acirc;n, or
Ruthin, whose owners&rsquo; mission in life, so far as the
Welsh were concerned, was to make themselves unpleasant.
Their claws, it is true, had been considerably
cut down by Edward the First, but the same
blood was there; and the habit of former years,
which looked upon the killing of a Welshman as a
meritorious action, only wanted an opportunity to
reassert itself.</p>

<p>Owen&rsquo;s rent-roll was about two hundred pounds a
year, and some slight mental effort is required to realise
that this was a very large one, both actually when
judged by the contemporary value of money, and
relatively as regards the financial standing of private
landowners, particularly in Wales, where this was
low. Owen was probably one of the richest native
Welshmen of his day. Few if any in the north had
such an opportunity of showing the contrast between
the simple and profuse hospitality of a native aristocrat,
and the stiff, contemptuous solemnity of the
lord of a Norman fortress. It was easy enough for
the descendant of Madoc ap Griffith to make himself
popular upon the banks of the upper Dee, and
Owen seems to have added a desire to do so to the
personal magnetism that the whole story of his life
shows him to have possessed in a very high degree.
All the bards of his own time and that immediately
following unite in this praise of his hospitality.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>108]</a></span>
Amid much fanciful exaggeration, such for instance
as that which compares Sycherth to &ldquo;Westminster
Abbey and Cheapside,&rdquo; there is no doubt about the
esteem and admiration in which Owen was held by
the Welsh and particularly by the bards who lived
at free quarters in his roomy halls. But all this
began before he had any idea of utilising his position
and popularity in the manner that has made him
immortal. There is really no authority at all for
making him a follower of Richard. All Wales and
Cheshire were indignant at the King&rsquo;s deposition and
treatment, and Glyndwr, even supposing his Irish
expedition to have been mythical, may well have
shared this indignation. But in such a case his
antecedents were, from private attachments, wholly
Lancastrian. Not only had he been Bolingbroke&rsquo;s
squire, but his former master, the Earl of Arundel,
had been a pronounced foe of the late King. Discontent
and turbulence were brooding everywhere,
but we have no reason to suppose that Glyndwr at
this date, the last year of the century, had any excuse
whatever for entering into dynastic quarrels.
On the contrary, unless the story of his recent connection
with Richard be true, he had much reason to
be contented with Bolingbroke&rsquo;s accession. At this
moment he was in all probability living quietly at
Sycherth, hunting deer amid the birchen woods and
bracken glades of the Berwyn and hawking in the
meadows of Llansilin. Amid all the pleasures, however,
which filled his rural life there rankled one
deep and bitter grievance, and this concerned the upland
tract of Croesau that lay upon the north-western
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>109]</a></span>
fringe of his Glyndyfrdwy manor, over which he and
his powerful neighbour, Reginald Grey, Lord of
Ruthin, had been falling out this many a long day.
The details of this quarrel, the primary cause of
that decade of strife which desolated Wales and profoundly
influenced the reign and embittered the life
of Henry of Bolingbroke, must be reserved for another
chapter.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br />
<br />
<span class="vsmlfont">GLYNDWR AND LORD GREY OF RUTHIN<br />
1400-1401</span></h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">R</span>EGINALD, <span class="smcap">Lord Grey</span>, of Ruthin, the prime
cause of all the wars that devastated Wales
and the English Marches throughout the first
ten years of the fifteenth century, was a typical Lord
Marcher, and was perhaps the worst of a fierce, unscrupulous,
and pitiless class. His ancestors had
been in the Vale of Clwyd for over a hundred years.
At Edward&rsquo;s conquest the first Earl had been planted
by the King at Ruthin to overawe the Welsh of
what is now northern Denbighshire and of the two
recently created counties of Flint and Carnarvon
which lay upon either side. There were other
Lord Marchers and other English garrisons between
Chester and Carnarvon, but at the time this story
opens the Greys were beyond a doubt the most ardent
and conspicuous props of the English Crown.
The great Red Castle at Ruthin, the &ldquo;Castell y
Gwern Loch,&rdquo; had risen in Edward&rsquo;s time beside the
upper waters of the Clwyd, and its ample ruins still
cluster round the modern towers where the successors
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>111]</a></span>
of the fierce Lord Marchers exercise a more peaceful
sway.</p>

<p class="caption">RUTHIN CASTLE.<br />
<br />
<small>FROM OLD PRINT.</small></p>
</div>

<p>Around Ruthin Castle, as at Denbigh, Conway, and
Carnarvon, a group of English adventurers&mdash;soldiers,
tradesmen, clerks, and gentlemen&mdash;had gathered
together and built for themselves habitations,
aided by favourable charters from the King, and still
greater favours from their lord, who leant upon their
services in times of danger. They led profitable,
if sometimes anxious lives. Welsh and English alike
pleaded before the lordship courts, whose records
may still be read by the curious in such matters.
Both Welsh and English laws, theoretically at any
rate, were administered within the lordship, but as
the Lord Marcher was, within his own domain, a law
unto himself, the state of affairs that existed at
Ruthin and similar places was complicated and is
not immediately pertinent to this story. It will be
quite accurate enough for present purposes to describe
Grey as surrounded and supported by armed
burghers and other dependents, mainly but not
wholly of English blood, while the mass of the
Welsh within his lordship, gentle and simple, remained
obedient to his rule from fear and not from
love. I need not trouble the reader with the limitations
of his territory, but merely remark that it
bordered upon that of Owen.</p>

<p>Now, upon the wild upland between the Dee valley
and the watershed of the Clwyd, lay the common
of Croesau, whose disputed ownership eventually
set Wales and England by the ears. This strip of
land had originally belonged to Owen&rsquo;s estate of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>112]</a></span>
Glyndyfrdwy. Lord Grey, however, in Richard the
Second&rsquo;s time, had, in high-handed fashion, appropriated
it to himself on the sole and poor excuse
that it marched with his own domain. Glyndwr,
being at that time probably no match for Grey at
the game of physical force, possessed his fiery soul
in patience, and carried the dispute in a peaceful
and orderly manner to the King&rsquo;s court in London.
Here the justice of his claim was recognised; he
won his suit and Lord Grey was compelled to withdraw
his people from the disputed territory, cherishing,
we may well believe, an undying grudge against
the Welshman who, before the eyes of all the world
and in an English court of justice, had got the better
of him.</p>

<p>Now, however, a new King was upon the throne,
and Owen apparently out of favour. The opportunity
was too good an one to be missed by the
grasping Norman, who, driving Owen&rsquo;s people off
the disputed territory, annexed it once more to his
own estate. Glyndwr nevertheless, whatever the
cause may have been, proved himself even under
this further provocation a law-abiding person, and,
refraining from all retaliation, carried his suit once
more to London and laid it before the Parliament
which Henry summoned in the spring of 1400,
six months after he had seized the throne. But
Owen, though he had been esquire to the King, was
now wholly out of favour, so much so as greatly to
support the tradition that he had served the unfortunate
Richard in a like capacity. His suit was not
even accorded the compliment of a hearing, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>113]</a></span>
was dismissed with contemptuous brevity. Trevor,
Bishop of St. Asaph, who was then about the King&rsquo;s
person and deeply in his confidence, protested in
vain against the unjust and ill-advised course. As
a Welshman, familiar with the condition of his own
country, he solemnly warned the authorities against
provoking a man who, though of only moderate
estate, was so powerful and so popular among his
own people.</p>

<p>The Bishop&rsquo;s pleadings were of no avail. &ldquo;What
care we for the barefooted rascals?&rdquo; was the scornful
reply. The Welsh were in fact already in an
electrical condition. In spite of their general discontent
with English rule, they had been attached to
Richard, and with that strength of personal loyalty
which in a Celtic race so often outweighs reason,
they resented with heartfelt indignation the usurpation
of Bolingbroke. They were very far from sure
that Richard was even dead. If he were, then Henry
had killed him, which made matters worse. But if
in truth he actually still lived, they were inclined to
murmur as loudly and with as much show of reason
at his dethronement. Richard, it will be remembered,
after having been compelled publicly and formally
to abdicate the throne, had been imprisoned
for a time in the Tower, and then secretly conveyed
from castle to castle till he reached Pontefract, where
he ended his wretched life. The manner of his death
remains to this day a mystery, as has been intimated
already. Whether he was murdered by Henry&rsquo;s
orders or whether his weakened constitution succumbed
to sorrow and confinement or bad treatment,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>114]</a></span>
no one will ever know. But his body, at any rate, was
brought to London and there exposed in St. Paul&rsquo;s
Cathedral for the space of three days, that all the
world might see that he was in truth dead. The
men of Wales and the North and West of England
had to take all this on hearsay, and were readily
persuaded that some trickery had been played on
the Londoners and that some substitute for Richard
had been exposed to their credulous gaze. For
years it was the policy of Henry&rsquo;s enemies to circulate
reports that Richard was still alive, and, as we
shall see in due course, his ghost was not actually
laid till the battle of Shrewsbury had been fought
and won by Henry. Indeed, so late as 1406 the old
Earl of Northumberland alleged, in a letter, the possibility
of his being alive, while even seven years
after this Sir John Oldcastle declared he would never
acknowledge Parliament so long as his master, King
Richard, still lived.</p>

<p>Glyndwr, after the insults that he had received in
London, returned home, as may well be conceived,
not in the best of tempers; Grey, however, was to
perpetrate even a worse outrage upon him than that
of which he had already been guilty and of a still
more treacherous nature. It so happened that at
this time the King was preparing for that expedition
against the Scots which started in July, 1400.
Among the nobility and gentry whom he summoned
to his standard was Glyndwr, and there is no reason
to assume that the Welshman would have failed
to answer the call. The summons, however, was
sent through Lord Grey, in his capacity of chief
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>115]</a></span>
Marcher in North Wales; and Grey, with incredibly
poor spite, kept Owen in ignorance of it till it was
too late for him either to join the King&rsquo;s army or
to forward an explanation. Glyndwr was on this account
credited at Court with being a malcontent
and a rebel; and as there had been some brawling
and turbulence upon the Welsh border the future
chieftain&rsquo;s name was included among those whom it
was Grey&rsquo;s duty, as it was his delight, to punish.
There is no evidence that Owen had stirred. It is
possible he might have made himself disagreeable to
Grey upon the marches of their respective properties.
It would be strange if he had not. There is
no mention, however, of his name in the trifling
racial disturbances that were natural to so feverish a
time.</p>

<p>It seems pretty evident that if the malicious Lord
Marcher had rested content with his plunder and let
sleeping dogs lie, Owen, and consequently Wales,
would never have risen. This ill-advised baron,
however, was by no means content. He applied for
further powers in a letter which is now extant, and
got leave to proceed in force against Owen, among
others, as a rebel, and to proclaim his estates, having
an eye, no doubt, to their convenient propinquity in
the event of confiscation.</p>

<p>But before Owen comes upon the scene, and during
this same summer, a most characteristic and
entertaining correspondence was being carried on
between the irascible Lord Grey and a defiant gentleman
of North Wales, Griffith ap Dafydd ap Griffith,
the &ldquo;strengest thief in Wales,&rdquo; Grey calls him,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>116]</a></span>
which is to say that he accuses him of carrying off
some horses from his park at Ruthin. The letters,
which are in Sir Thomas Ellis&rsquo;s collection, are much
too long to reproduce, but they show unmistakably
and not without humour, the relations which existed
between Lord Grey and some of his Welsh neighbours,
who, already turbulent, were later on to follow
Glyndwr into the field of battle. The King, before
starting for Scotland and before getting Grey&rsquo;s letters,
had commanded his Lord Marchers to use conciliation
to all dissatisfied Welshmen and to offer
free pardons to any who were openly defying his
authority.</p>

<p>Griffith ap Dafydd, it seems, had been prominent
among these restive souls, but under a promise,
he declares in his letter, of being made the
Master Forester and &ldquo;Keyshat&rdquo; of Chirkeland
under the King&rsquo;s charter, he had presented himself
at Oswestry and claimed both the pardon
and the office. In the last matter his claim was
scouted, according to his own account, with scandalous
breach of faith, and even his bodily safety
did not seem wholly secure from the King&rsquo;s friends.
He narrates at some length the story of his wrongs,
and tells Grey that he has heard of his intention
to burn and slay in whatever country he [Griffith]
is in. &ldquo;Without doubt,&rdquo; he continues &ldquo;as many
men as ye slay and as many houses as ye burn for
my sake, as many will I burn and slay for your
sake,&rdquo; and &ldquo;doute not that I will have bredde and
ale of the best that is in your Lordschip.&rdquo; There
is something delightfully inconsequent in Griffith&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>117]</a></span>
method of ending this fire-breathing epistle: &ldquo;Wretten
in grete haste at the Park of Brunkiffe the XIth
day of June. I can no more, but God kepe your
Worschipful estate in prosperity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Grey of Ruthin was filled with wrath at this impudence
and replied to the &ldquo;strengest thief in Wales&rdquo;
at great length, reserving his true sentiments, however,
for the conclusion, where he bursts into rhyme:
&ldquo;But we hoope we shall do thee a pryve thyng: A
roope, a ladder and a ring, heigh in a gallowes for to
heng. And thus shall be your endyng. And he that
made the be ther to helpyng. And we on our behalf
shall be well willing for thy letter is knowlechyng.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is quite evident that the Greys had not lived,
aliens though they were, in the land of bards
for five generations for nothing. Full of wrath,
and by no means free from panic, Grey writes off in
all haste to the young Prince Henry, who is acting as
regent during his father&rsquo;s absence in the north. He
encloses a duplicate of his answer to the &ldquo;strengest
thief in Wales&rdquo; and advises the Prince of the &ldquo;Misgovernance
and riote which is beginning heer in the
Marches of North Wales.&rdquo; He begs for a fuller
commission to act against the rebels, one that will
enable him to pursue and take them in the &ldquo;Kyng&rsquo;s
ground&rdquo;; in the counties, that is to say, where the
King&rsquo;s writ runs, and not merely in the lordships
which covered what are now the counties of Denbigh
and Montgomery. &ldquo;But worshipful and gracious
Lorde, ye most comaunden the Kynge&rsquo;s
officers in every Cuntree to do the same.&rdquo; Grey
goes on to declare that there are many officers, some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>118]</a></span>
in the King&rsquo;s shires, others in the lordships of Mortimer
at Denbigh and of Arundel at Dinas Br&acirc;n and
in Powysland, that are &ldquo;kin unto these men that be
risen, and tyll ye putte these officers in better governance
this Countrie of North Wales shall nevere
have peese.&rdquo; He enclosed also the letter of the
&ldquo;strengest thief,&rdquo; and begs the Prince to read it and
judge for himself what sort of people he has to face.
He urges him to listen carefully to the full tidings
that his poor messenger and esquire Richard Donne
will give him, and to take counsel with the King for
providing some more sufficient means of curbing the
turbulent Welshmen than he now has at his disposal.
&ldquo;Else trewly hitt will be an unruly Cuntree
within short time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>About the same time similar despatches to the
Prince sitting in Council were flying across Wales
penned by one of the King&rsquo;s own officers, the Chamberlain
of Carnarvon. These informed the authorities,
among other things, that the Constable of
Harlech had trustworthy evidence of a certain Meredith
ap Owen, under whose protection it may be
mentioned Griffith ap Dafydd, Grey&rsquo;s correspondent,
lived, being in secret negotiation with the men
of the outer isles (&ldquo;owt yles&rdquo;) of Scotland, &ldquo;through
letters in and owt,&rdquo; that these Scottish Celts were to
land suddenly at Abermaw (Barmouth), and that
Meredith had warned his friends to be in readiness
with horses and harness against the appointed time.
It was also rumoured from this same source upon
the Merioneth coast that men were buying and even
stealing horses, and providing themselves with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>119]</a></span>
saddles, bows, arrows, and armour. &ldquo;Recheles men of
divers Countries,&rdquo; too, were assembling in desolate
and wild places and meeting privily, though their
councils were still kept secret, and by these means
the young men of Wales were being greatly demoralised.</p>

<p>No special notice seems to have been taken of these
urgent warnings by those whom the King during his
absence in the north had left to guard his interests.
Tumults and disturbances continued both in Wales
and on the Marches throughout the summer, but
nothing in the shape of a general rising took place
till the luckless Grey, armed perhaps with the fresh
powers he had sought for, singled out Glyndwr
again as the object of his vengeance. Glyndwr had
shown no signs as yet of giving trouble. His name
is not mentioned in the correspondence of this summer,
although he was the leading and most influential
Welshman upon the northern Marches. He or
his people may have given Grey some annoyance, or
been individually troublesome along the boundaries
of the property of which he had robbed them.
But the Lord Marcher in all likelihood was merely
following up his old grudge in singling out Owen for
his first operations, though it is possible that, having
regard to the latter&rsquo;s great influence and the seething
state of Wales, he thought it politic to remove a
man who, smarting under a sense of injustice, might
recommend himself for every reason as a capable
leader to his countrymen. One would have supposed
that the &ldquo;strengest thief in Wales&rdquo; would
have claimed Grey&rsquo;s first attention, but Griffith ap
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>120]</a></span>
Dafydd, who dates his letter from &ldquo;Brunkiffe,&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> a
name that baffles identification, was very likely out
of ordinary reach. However that may be, the Lord
of Ruthin, collecting his forces and joining them to
those of his brother Marcher, Earl Talbot of Chirk,
moved so swiftly and unexpectedly upon Owen that
he had only just time to escape from his house and
seek safety in the neighbouring woodlands before it
was surrounded by his enemies. Whether this notable
incident, so fraught with weighty consequences,
took place upon the Dee or the Cynllaeth&mdash;at Glyndyfrdwy,
that is to say, or at Sycherth&mdash;is uncertain;
conjecture certainly favours the latter supposition,
since Sycherth was beyond a doubt the most important
of Owen&rsquo;s mansions, as well as his favourite
residence. Nearly all historians have hopelessly
confounded these two places, which are seven or
eight miles apart as the crow flies and cut off from
each other by the intervening masses of the Berwyn
Mountains. Seeing, however, that Pennant, the
Welshman of topographical and archeological renown,
falls into this curious mistake and never penetrated
to the real Sycherth or seemed aware of its
existence, it is not surprising that most English and
even Welsh writers have followed suit.</p>

</div>

<p>It is of no importance to our story which of the
two manors was the scene of Owen&rsquo;s escape and his
enemy&rsquo;s disappointment, but the attack upon him
filled the Welshman&rsquo;s cup of bitterness to the brim.
It was the last straw upon a load of foolish and
wanton insult; and of a truth it was an evil day for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>121]</a></span>
Grey of Ruthin, and for his master, Henry, that saw
this lion hunted from his lair; and an evil day perhaps
for Wales, for, though it gave her the hero she
most cherishes, it gave her at the same time a
decade of utter misery and clouded the whole of
the fifteenth century with its disastrous effects.</p>

<p>Henry was very anxious to conciliate the Welsh.
Sore and angry as they were at the deposition of
their favourite, Richard, the desultory lawlessness
which smouldered on throughout the summer would
to a certainty have died out, or remained utterly impotent
for serious mischief, before the conciliatory
mood of the King, had no leader for the Welsh
been found during his absence in the north.
Henry had beyond question abetted his council in
their contemptuous treatment of his old esquire&rsquo;s
suit against Grey. But he may not unnaturally
have had some personal grievance himself against
Owen as a sympathiser with Richard; a soreness,
moreover, which must have been still further aggravated
if the tradition of his taking service under
the late King be a true one. Of the attachment
of the Welsh to Richard, and their resentment at
Henry&rsquo;s usurpation, we get an interesting glimpse
from an independent source in the manuscript of
M. Creton, a French knight who fought with Richard
in Ireland and remained for some time after
his deposition at the English Court. He was present
at the coronation of young Prince Henry as
Prince of Wales, which took place early in this
year. &ldquo;Then arose Duke Henry,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;the
King&rsquo;s eldest son, who humbly knelt before him,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>122]</a></span>
and he made him Prince of Wales and gave him the
land. But I think he must conquer it if he will have
it, for in my opinion the Welsh would on no account
allow him to be their lord, for the sorrow, evil, and
disgrace which the English together with his father
had brought on King Richard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Welsh had now found a leader indeed and a
chief after their own heart. Owen was forty-one,
handsome, brave, and, as events were soon to prove,
as able as he was courageous. Above all, the blood
of Powys and of Llewelyn ab Iorwerth flowed in his
veins. He was just the man, not only to lead them
but to arouse the enthusiasm and stir up the long-crushed
patriotism of an emotional and martial race.
He seems to have stept at once to the front, and to
have been hailed with acclamation by all the restless
spirits that had been making the lives of the Lord
Marchers a burden to them throughout the summer,
and a host of others who had hitherto had no
thought of a serious appeal to arms. His standard,
the ancient red dragon of Wales upon a white
ground, was raised either at, or in the neighbourhood
of, his second estate of Glyndyfrdwy, possibly
at Corwen, where many valleys that were populous
even then draw together, and where the ancient
British camp of Caer Drewyn, lifted many hundred
feet above the Dee, suggests a rare post both for
outlook, rendezvous, and defence. Hither flocked
the hardy mountaineers with their bows and spears,
not &ldquo;ragged barefoots,&rdquo; as English historians, on
the strength of a single word, <i>nudepedibus</i>, used
by an Englishman in London, have called them in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>123]</a></span>
careless and offhand fashion, but men in great part
well armed, as became a people accustomed to war
both at home and abroad, and well clad, as became
a peasantry who were as yet prosperous and had
never known domestic slavery. From the vales of
Edeyrnion and Llangollen; from the wild uplands,
too, of Yale and Bryn Eglwys; from the fertile banks
of the Ceiriog and the sources of the Clwyd; and
from the farther shores of Bala Lake, where beneath
the shadow of the Arans and Arenig Fawr population
clustered thick even in those distant days, came
pouring forth the tough and warlike sons of Wales.
In the van of all came the bards, carrying not only
their harps but the bent bow, symbol of war. It
was to them, indeed, that Glyndwr owed in great
measure the swift and universal recognition that
made him at once the man of the hour. Of all
classes of Welshmen the bardic orders were the
most passionately patriotic. For an hundred years
their calling had been a proscribed one. Prior to
Edward the First&rsquo;s conquest a regular tax, the
&ldquo;Cwmwrth,&rdquo; had been laid upon the people for
their support. Since then they had slunk about,
if not, as is sometimes said, in terror of their lives,
yet dependent always for their support on private
charity and doles.</p>

<p>But no laws could have repressed song in Wales,
and indeed this period seems a singularly prolific
one both in poets and minstrels. They persuaded
themselves that their deliverance from the Saxon
grip was at hand, and saw in the valiant figure of
Owain of Glyndyfrdwy the fulfilment of the ancient
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>124]</a></span>
prophecies that a Welsh prince should once again
wear the crown of Britain. Glyndwr well knew
that the sympathy of the bards would prove to him
a tower of strength, and he met them more than
half way. If he was not superstitious himself he
understood how to play upon the superstition and
romantic nature of his countrymen. The old prophecies
were ransacked, portents were rife in sea
and sky. The most ordinary occurrences of nature
were full of significant meaning for Owen&rsquo;s followers
and for all Welshmen at that moment, whether
they followed him or not; and in the month of
August Owen declared himself, and by an already
formidable body of followers was declared, &ldquo;Prince
of Wales.&rdquo; His friend and laureate, Iolo Goch, was
by his side and ready for the great occasion.</p>

<p>Glyndwr would hardly have been human if he
had not made his first move upon his relentless enemy,
Lord Grey of Ruthin. There is no evidence
whether the latter was himself at home or not, but
Owen fell upon the little town on a Fair day and
made a clean sweep of the stock and valuables
therein collected. Thence he passed eastwards, harrying
and burning the property of English settlers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>125]</a></span>
or English sympathisers. Crossing the English
border and spreading panic everywhere, he invaded
western Shropshire, capturing castles and burning
houses and threatening even Shrewsbury.</p>

<p>The King, who had effected nothing in the North,
was pulled up sharply by the grave news from Wales
and prepared to hasten southwards. By September
3rd he had retraced his steps as far as Durham, and
passing through Pontefract, Doncaster, and Leicester
arrived at Northampton about the 14th of the
same month. Here fuller details reached him, and
he deemed it necessary to postpone the Parliament
which he had proposed to hold at Westminster in
September, till the beginning of the following year,
1401. From Northampton Henry issued summons
to the sheriffs of the midland and border counties
that they were to join him instantly with their
levies, and that he was proceeding without delay to
quell the insurrection that had broken out in North
Wales. He wrote also to the people of Shrewsbury,
warning them to be prepared against all attacks, and
to provide against the treachery of any Welshmen
that might be residing within the town. Then, moving
rapidly forward and taking his son, the young
Prince Henry, with him, he reached Shrewsbury
about the 24th of the month.</p>

<p>Henry&rsquo;s crown had hitherto been a thorny one
and he had derived but little satisfaction from it.
The previous winter had witnessed the desperate
plot from which he only saved himself by his rapid
ride to London from Windsor, and the subsequent
capture and execution of the Earls of Salisbury,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>126]</a></span>
Kent, and Huntington, who had been the ringleaders.
From his unsteady throne he saw both France
and Scotland awaiting only an opportune moment
to strike him. The whole spring had been passed
in diplomatic endeavours to keep them quiet till he
was sure of his own subjects. Isabella, the daughter
of the King of France and child-widow of the late
King Richard, had brought with her a considerable
dower, and the hope of getting a part of this back,
together with the young Queen herself, had kept
the French quiet. But Scotland, that ill-governed
and turbulent country, had been chafing under ten
years of peace; and its people, or rather the restless
barons who governed them, were getting hungry for
the plunder of their richer neighbours in the South,
and, refusing all terms, were already crossing the
border. Under ordinary circumstances an English
king might have left such matters in the hands of
his northern nobles. But it seemed desirable to
Henry that he should, on the first occasion, show
both to the Scotch and his own people of what
mettle he was made. He was also angered at the
lack of decent excuse for their aggressions. So
he hurried northward, as we have seen, and having
hurled the invaders back over the border as far as
Edinburgh, he had for lack of food just returned
to Newcastle when the bad news from Wales arrived.
He was now at Shrewsbury, within striking distance,
as it seemed, of the Welsh rebels and their arch-leader,
his old esquire, Glyndwr. Neither Henry
nor his soldiers knew anything of Welsh campaigning
or of Welsh tactics, for five generations had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>127]</a></span>
passed away since Englishmen had marched and
fought in that formidable country and against their
ancient and agile foes. Henry the Fourth, so far
as we can judge, regarded the task before him with
a light heart. At any rate he wasted some little
time at Shrewsbury, making an example of the first
Welshman of importance and mischievous tendencies
that fell into his hands. This was one Grenowe ap
Tudor, whose quarters, after he had been executed
with much ceremony, were sent to ornament the
gates of Bristol, Hereford, Ludlow, and Chester, respectively.
The King then moved into Wales with
all his forces, thinking, no doubt, to crush Glyndwr
and his irregular levies in a short time and without
much difficulty. This was the first of his many
luckless campaigns in pursuit of his indomitable and
wily foe, and perhaps it was the least disastrous.
For though he effected nothing against the Welsh
troops and did not even get a sight of them, he at
least got out of the country without feeling the
prick of their spears, which is more than can be
said of almost any of his later ventures. His invasion
of Wales, in fact, upon this occasion was a promenade
and is described as such in contemporary
records. He reached Anglesey without incident,
and there for the sake of example drove out the
Minorite friars from the Abbey of Llanfaes near
Beaumaris, on the plea that they were friends of
Owen. The plea seems to have been a sound one,
for the Franciscans were without doubt the one
order of the clergy that favoured Welsh independence.
But Henry, not content with this, plundered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>128]</a></span>
their abbey, an inexcusable act, and one for which
in after years some restitution appears to have been
made. Bad weather and lack of supplies, as on all
after occasions, proved the King&rsquo;s worst enemies.
Glyndwr and his people lay snug within the Snowdon
mountains, and by October 17th, Henry, having
set free at Shrewsbury a few prisoners he brought
with him, was back at Worcester. Here he declared
the estates of Owen to be confiscated and bestowed
them on his own half-brother, Beaufort, Earl
of Somerset. He little thought at that time how
many years would elapse before an English nobleman
could venture to take actual possession of
Sycherth or Glyndyfrdwy.</p>

<p>Upon November 20th a general pardon was
offered to all Welsh rebels who would come in and
report themselves at Shrewsbury or Chester, the now
notorious Owen always excepted, and on this occasion
Griffith Hanmer, his brother-in-law, and one of
the famous Norman-Welsh family of Pulestone had
the honour of being fellow-outlaws with their chief.
Their lands also were confiscated and bestowed on
two of the King&rsquo;s friends. It is significant, however,
of the anxiety regarding the future which Glyndwr&rsquo;s
movement had inspired, that the grantee of the
Hanmer estates, which all lay in Flint, was very glad
to come to terms with a member of the family and
take a trifling annuity instead of the doubtful privilege
of residence and rent collecting. The castle of
Carnarvon was strongly garrisoned. Henry, Prince
of Wales, then only in his fourteenth year, was left
at Chester with a suitable council and full powers of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>129]</a></span>
exercising clemency toward all Welshmen lately in
arms, other than the three notable exceptions already
mentioned, who should petition for it. Few, however,
if any, seem to have taken the trouble to do
even thus much. And in the meantime the King,
still holding the Welsh rebellion as of no great
moment, spent the winter in London entertaining the
Greek Emperor and haggling with the King of France
about the return of the money paid to Richard as
the dower of his child-queen, Isabella, who was still
detained in London as in some sort a hostage.</p>

<p>Parliament sat early in 1401 and was by no means
as confident as Henry seemed to be regarding the
state of Wales, a subject which formed the chief
burden of their debate. Even here, perhaps, the
gravity of the Welsh movement was not entirely
realised; the authorities were angry but scarcely
alarmed; no one remembered the old Welsh wars or
the traditional defensive tactics of the Welsh, and
the fact of Henry having swept through the Principality
unopposed gave rise to misconceptions. There
was no question, however, about their hostility towards
Wales, and in the early spring of this year the
following ordinances for the future government of
the Principality were published.</p>

<p>(1) All lords of castles in Wales were to have them
properly secured against assault on pain of forfeiture.</p>

<p>(2) No Welshman in future was to be a Justice,
Chamberlain, Chancellor, Seneschal, Receiver, Chief
Forester, Sheriff, Escheator, Constable of a castle, or
Keeper of rolls or records. All these offices were to be
held by Englishmen, who were to reside at their posts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>130]</a></span>
(3) The people of a district were to be held responsible
for all breaches of the peace in their
neighbourhood and were to be answerable in their
own persons for all felons, robbers, and trespassers
found therein.</p>

<p>(4) All felons and evildoers were to be immediately
handed over to justice and might not be
sheltered on any pretext by any lord in any castle.</p>

<p>(5) The Welsh people were to be taxed and
charged with the expense of repairing and maintaining
walls, gates, and castles in North Wales when
wilfully destroyed, and for refurnishing them and
keeping them in order, at the discretion of the owner,
for a term not exceeding three years, except under
special orders from the King.</p>

<p>(6) No meetings of Welsh were to be held without
the permission of the chief officers of the lordship,
who were to be held responsible for any damage
or riot that ensued.</p>

<p>The gifts called &ldquo;Cwmwrth,&rdquo; too, exacted by collection
for the maintenance of the bards or minstrels,
were strictly interdicted. Adam of Usk, one of the
few lay chroniclers of this period, was himself present
at the Parliament of 1401 and heard &ldquo;many harsh
things&rdquo; to be put in force against the Welsh: among
others, &ldquo;that they should not marry with English, nor
get them wealth, nor dwell in England.&rdquo; Also that
the men of the Marches &ldquo;might use reprisals against
Welshmen who were their debtors or who had injured
them,&rdquo; a truce for a week being first granted to
give them the opportunity of making amends.</p>

</div>

<p>It was much easier, however, to issue commands
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>131]</a></span>
and instructions than to carry them out. The King
seems to have felt this, and leant strongly towards a
greater show of clemency. But there was sufficient
panic in parts of England to override the royal
scruples or common sense, and so far as intentions
went the Welsh were to be shown little mercy.</p>

<p>Owen all this time had been lying quietly in the
valley of the upper Dee, preparing for still further
endeavours. The short days and the long nights of
winter saw the constant passing to and fro of innumerable
sympathisers through the valleys and
over the hills of both North and South Wales, and a
hundred harps, that had long been faint or silent,
were sounding high to the glories of the unforgotten
heroes of Old Wales. Mere hatred of Henry and
tenderness for Richard&rsquo;s memory were giving place
to ancient dreams of Cambrian independence and a
fresh burst of hatred for the Saxon yoke. Owen,
too strong now to fear anything from isolated efforts
of Lord Marchers, seems to have held high festival
at Glyndyfrdwy during the winter, and with the assumption
of princely rank to have kept up something
of the nature of princely state. With the exception
of Grey to the north and the lords of Chirk
upon the east, it is probable that nearly everyone
around him was by now either his friend or in
wholesome dread of his displeasure.</p>

<p>Shropshire was panic-stricken for the time. Hotspur
was busy at Denbigh, and Glyndwr, among his
native hills, had it, no doubt, very much his own way
during the winter months, and made full use of them
to push forward his interests. His property, it will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>132]</a></span>
be remembered, had been confiscated. But so far
from anyone venturing to take possession of Glyndyfrdwy,
its halls, we are told, at this time rang with
revelry and song, while Owen, in the intervals of
laying his plans and organising his campaign for the
ensuing summer, received the homage of the bards
who flocked from every part of the principality to
throw their potent influence into the scale. However
much Glyndwr&rsquo;s vanity and ambition may have
been stirred by the enthusiasm which surged around
him, and the somewhat premature exultation that
with wild rhapsody hailed him as the restorer of
Welsh independence, he never for a moment lost
sight of the stern issues he had to face, or allowed
himself to be flattered into overconfidence. Courage
and coolness, perseverance and sagacity, were
his leading attributes. He well knew that the enthusiasm
of the bards was of vital consequence to the
first success of his undertaking. It is of little moment
whether he shared the superstitions of those
who sang of the glorious destiny for which fate had
marked him or of those who listened to the singing.
It is not likely that a man who showed himself so
able and so cool a leader would fail to take full advantage
of forces which at this early stage were so
supremely valuable.</p>

<p>He knew his countrymen and he knew the world,
and when Wales was quivering with excitement beneath
the interpretation of ancient prophecies bruited
hither and thither and enlarged upon by poetic
and patriotic fancy, Glyndwr was certainly not the
man to damp their ardour by any display of criticism.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>133]</a></span>
Already the great news from Wales had thrilled
the heart of many a Welshman poring over his
books at the university, or following the plough-tail
over English fallows. They heard of friends and
relatives selling their stock to buy arms and harness,
and in numbers that yet more increased as the year
advanced, began to steal home again, all filled with
a rekindled glow of patriotism that a hundred years
of union and, in their cases, long mingling with the
Saxon had not quenched. Oxford, particularly, sent
many recruits to Owen, and this is not surprising,
seeing how combative was the Oxford student of
that time and how clannish his proclivities. Adam
of Usk, who has told us a good deal about Glyndwr&rsquo;s
insurrection, was himself an undergraduate
some dozen years before it broke out, and has given
us a brief and vivid picture of the ferocious fights
upon more or less racial lines, in which the Welsh
chronicler not only figured prominently himself, but
was an actual leader of his countrymen; &ldquo;was indicted,&rdquo;
he tells us, &ldquo;for felonious riot and narrowly
escaped conviction, being tried by a jury empanelled
before a King&rsquo;s Judge. After this I feared the
King hitherto unknown to me and put hooks in my
jaws.&rdquo; These particular riots were so formidable
that the scholars for the most part, after several had
been slain, departed to their respective countries.</p>

<p>In the very next year, however, &ldquo;Thomas
Speke, Chaplain, with a multitude of other malefactors,
appointing captains among them, rose up
against the peace of the King and sought after all
the Welshmen abiding and studying in Oxford,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>134]</a></span>
shooting arrows after them in divers streets and lanes
as they went, crying out, &lsquo;War! war! war! Sle Sle
Sle the Welsh doggys and her whelpys; ho so
looketh out of his house he shall in good sooth be
dead,&rsquo; and certain persons they slew and others they
grievously wounded, and some of the Welshmen,
who bowed their knees to abjure the town,&rdquo; they
led to the gates with certain indignities not to be
repeated to ears polite. We may also read the names
of the different halls which were broken into, and of
Welsh scholars who were robbed of their books and
chattels, including in some instances their harps.</p>

<p>It is not altogether surprising, therefore, that
Welsh Oxonians should have hailed the opportunity
of Owen&rsquo;s rising to pay off old scores. We have the
names of some of those who joined him in an original
paper, in the Rolls of Parliament, which fully
corroborates the notice of this event; Howel Kethin
(Gethin) &ldquo;bachelor of law, duelling in Myghell Hall,
Oxenford,&rdquo; was one of them; &ldquo;Maister Morres Stove,
of the College of Excestre,&rdquo; was another, while
David Brith, John Lloid, and several others are mentioned
by name. One David Leget seems to have
been regarded as such an addition that Owen himself
sent a special summons that he &ldquo;schuld com till
hym and be his man.&rdquo; So things in Wales went
from bad to worse; Glyndwr&rsquo;s forces gaining rapidly
in strength and numbers, and actively preparing in
various quarters for the operations that marked the
open season of 1401.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br />
<br />
<span class="vsmlfont">OWEN AND THE PERCYS<br />
1401</span></h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">N</span>ORTH WALES, as already mentioned, was
being now administered by the young Prince
Henry, with the help of a council whose
headquarters were at Chester. Under their orders,
and their most active agent at this time, was Henry
Percy, the famous Hotspur, eldest son of the Earl of
Northumberland. He was Justice of North Wales
and Constable of the castles of Chester, Flint, Conway,
Denbigh, and Carnarvon, and had recently
been granted the whole island of Anglesey. Hotspur,
for obvious reasons, made his headquarters at
the high-perched and conveniently situated fortress
of Denbigh, which Lacy, Earl of Lincoln, had built
at the Edwardian conquest. Its purpose was to
overawe the lower portion of the Vale of Clwyd,
which had fallen to Lacy&rsquo;s share at the great division
of plunder that signalised the downfall of the last of
the Welsh native Princes. The lordship of Denbigh,
it may be remarked parenthetically, since the
fact becomes one of some significance later on,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>136]</a></span>
belonged at this time to the Mortimers, into which
famous family Henry Percy had married. The latter,
to whose house the King was under such great
obligations, was the leading exponent of his master&rsquo;s
policy in Wales, both in matters of peace and war,
and had been sufficiently loaded with favours to at
least equalise the balance of mutual indebtedness
between the houses of Northumberland and Lancaster.</p>

<p>Shakespeare&rsquo;s fancy and dramatic instinct has
played sad havoc in most people&rsquo;s minds with the
mutual attitude of some of the leading figures of
this stormy period. It has been sufficiently disproved
by his biographers, if not, indeed, by the
facts of general history, that Henry of Monmouth
was no more the dissipated, light-headed trifler and
heartless brawler than was Glyndwr the half-barbarous
and wholly boastful personage that Shakespeare
has placed upon his stage. The King, it will
be remembered, is depicted, in the play that bears
his name, as bewailing with embittered eloquence
the contrast between the characters of Hotspur and
his own son, and making vain laments that the infants
had not been changed while they lay side by
side in their cradles. It is something of a shock to
recall the fact that Henry Percy was a little older
than the distraught father himself, and a contemporary,
not of the Prince, but of the King, who was
now about thirty-five, and many years younger than
Glyndwr.</p>

<p>Prince Henry, even now, though not yet fourteen,
seems to have had a mind of his own. He had, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>137]</a></span>
truth, to face early the stern facts and hard realities
of a life such as would have sobered and matured a
less naturally precocious and intelligent nature than
his. His youth was not spent in frivolity and debauchery
in London, but upon the Welsh border,
for the most part, amid the clash of arms or the
more trying strain of political responsibility, aggravated
by constant want of funds. One might almost
say that Henry of Monmouth&rsquo;s whole early manhood
was devoted to a fierce and ceaseless struggle
with Glyndwr for that allegiance of the Welsh people
to which both laid claim. In later years, as we shall
see, it was the tenacity and soldier-like qualities of
the Prince that succeeded where veteran warriors
had failed, and that ultimately broke the back of
Glyndwr&rsquo;s long and fierce resistance. The King, far
from deploring the conduct or character of his valiant
son, always treated him with the utmost confidence,
and invariably speaks of him in his correspondence
with unreserved affection and pride. He was of
&ldquo;spare make,&rdquo; say the chroniclers who knew him,
&ldquo;tall and well proportioned, exceeding the stature of
men, beautiful of visage, and small of bone.&rdquo; He
was of &ldquo;marvellous strength, pliant and passing
swift of limb; and so trained to feats of agility by
discipline and exercise, that with one or two of his
lords he could on foot readily give chase to a deer
without hounds, bow, or sling, and catch the fleetest
of the herd.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Either from a feeling that Hotspur was too strong,
or that popular fervour had perhaps been sufficiently
aroused to the north of the Dovey, Glyndwr now
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>138]</a></span>
turned his attention to the southern and midland
districts of the country. But before following him
there I must say something of the incident which
was of chief importance at the opening of this year&rsquo;s
operations.</p>

<p>Conway will probably be more familiar to the general
reader than any other scene of conflict we shall
visit in this volume, from the fact of its being so
notable a landmark on the highway between England
and Ireland. The massive towers and walls of the
great castle which Edward the First&rsquo;s architect, Henry
de Elfreton, raised here at the conquest of Wales, still
throw their shadows on the broad tidal river that
laps their feet. The little town which lies beneath
its ramparts and against the shore is still bound fast
within a girdle of high, embattled walls, strengthened
at measured intervals by nearly thirty towers, and
presenting a complete picture of medieval times such
as in all Britain is unapproached, while immediately
above it, if anything were needed to give further
distinction to a scene in itself so eloquent of a
storied past, rise to heaven the northern bulwarks of
the Snowdon range. Here, in the early spring of
this year, within the castle, lay a royal garrison
closely beset by the two brothers, William and Rhys
ap Tudor, of the ever famous stock of Penmynydd
in Anglesey. They had both been excluded from
the King&rsquo;s pardon, together with Glyndwr, among
whose lieutenants they were to prove themselves at
this period the most formidable to the English power.</p>

<p>Conway Castle, as may readily be believed by
those familiar with it, was practically impregnable,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>139]</a></span>
so long as a score or two of armed men with sufficient
to sustain life and strength remained inside it.
The Tudors, however, achieved by stealth what the
force at their command could not at that time have
accomplished by other means. For while the garrison
were at church, a partisan of the Glyndwr faction
was introduced into the castle in the disguise of a
carpenter, and after killing the warders he admitted
William ap Tudor and some forty men. They found
a fair stock of provisions within the castle, though,
as will be seen, it proved in the end insufficient.
The main body of the besiegers retired under Rhys
ap Tudor to the hills overlooking the town to await
developments. They were not long left in suspense,
for the news of the seizure of the castle roused Hotspur
to activity, and he hastened to the spot with all
the men that he could collect. Conway being one
of Edward&rsquo;s fortified and chartered English towns,
the inhabitants were presumably loyal to the King.
But Hotspur brought five hundred archers and men-at-arms
and great engines, including almost certainly
some of the primitive cannon of the period, to bear
on the castle. William ap Tudor and his forty men
laughed at their efforts till Hotspur, despairing of
success by arms, went on to Carnarvon, leaving his
whole force behind, to try the effect of starvation on
the garrison.</p>

<p>At Carnarvon Henry Percy held his sessions as
Justice of North Wales, openly proclaiming a pardon
in the name of his master the Prince to all who
would come in and give up their arms. From here,
too, he sent word in a letter, still extant, that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>140]</a></span>
commons of Carnarvon and Merioneth had come before
him, thanking the King and Prince for their
clemency and offering to pay the same dues as they
had paid King Richard. He also declared that the
northern districts, with the exception of the forces
at Conway, were rapidly coming back to their allegiance.
How sanguine and premature Hotspur was
in this declaration will soon be clear enough.</p>

<p>In the meantime much damage had been done to
Conway town by both besiegers and besieged. The
latter seem to have overestimated the resources they
found within the castle, for by the end of April they
were making overtures for terms. William ap Tudor
offered on behalf of his followers to surrender the
place if a full and unconditional pardon should be
granted to all inside. Hotspur was inclined to accept
this proposal, but the council at Chester and the King
himself, getting word of his intention, objected, and
with justice, to such leniency. So the negotiations
drag on. The King in a letter to his son remarks
that, as the castle fell by the carelessness of Henry
Percy&rsquo;s people, that same &ldquo;dear and faithful cousin&rdquo;
ought to see that it was retaken without concessions
to those holding it, and, moreover, pay all the expenses
out of his own pocket. In any case he urges
that, if he himself is to pay the wages and maintenance
of the besieging force, and supply their imposing
siege train, he would like to see something more
substantial for the outlay than a full and free pardon
to the rebels who had caused it. It was the beginning
of July before an agreement was finally arrived
at, to the effect that if nine of the garrison, not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>141]</a></span>
specified, were handed over to justice, the rest
should be granted both their lives and a free pardon.
The selection of the nine inside the castle was made
on a strange method, if method it can be called.
For the leaders, having made an arbitrary and privy
choice of the victims, had them seized and bound
suddenly in the night. They were then handed over
to Percy&rsquo;s troops, who slaughtered them after the
usual brutal fashion of the time.</p>

<p>A second letter of Henry Percy&rsquo;s to the council
demonstrates conclusively how seriously he had been
at fault in his previous estimate. This time he
writes from Denbigh under date of May 17th, pressing
for the payment of arrears in view of the desperate
state of North Wales, and further declaring
that if he did not receive some money shortly he
must resign his position to others and leave the
country by the end of the month. But Hotspur
rose superior to his threats; for at the end of May,
at his own risk and expense, he made an expedition
against a force of Glyndwr&rsquo;s people that were in arms
around Dolgelly. He was accompanied by the Earl
of Arundel and Sir Hugh Browe, a gentleman of
Cheshire. An action was fought of an indecisive
nature at the foot of Cader Idris, after which Percy
returned to Denbigh. Finding here no answer to
his urgent appeal for support, he threw up all his
Welsh appointments in disgust and left the country
for the more congenial and familiar neighbourhood
of the Scottish border. For he held office here also,
being joined with his father in the wardenship of
the Eastern Marches of Scotland.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>142]</a></span>
Hotspur was even now, at this early stage and
with some apparent cause, in no very good humour
with the King. It is certain, too, that Glyndwr at
this time had some special liking for the Percys,
though they were his open enemies, and it is almost
beyond question that they had a personal interview
at some place and date unknown during the summer.</p>

<p>Leaving North Wales in a seething and turbulent
state, with local partisans heading bands of insurgents
(if men who resist an usurper can be called insurgents)
in various parts of the country, we must turn to
Owen and the South. Crossing the Dovey, Glyndwr
had sought the mountain range that divides Cardigan
from what is now Radnorshire (then known as the
district of Melenydd), and raised his standard upon
the rounded summit of Plinlimmon. It was a fine
position, lying midway between North and South
Wales, within sight of the sea and at the same time
within striking distance of the fertile districts of the
Centre and the South. Behind him lay the populous
seaboard strip of Ceredigion created at Edward&rsquo;s
conquest into the county of Cardigan. Before him
lay Radnor, and Carmarthen, and the fat lordships
of Brycheiniog, to be welded later into the modern
county of Brecon. Along the Cardiganshire coast
in Owen&rsquo;s rear a string of castles frowned out upon
the Irish Sea, held, since it was a royal county, by the
constables of the King, who were sometimes of
English, sometimes of Welsh, nationality. Inland, as
far as the Herefordshire border, was a confused network
of lordships, held for the most part direct from
the King on feudal tenure by English or Anglo-Welsh
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>143]</a></span>
nobles, and each dominated by one or more
grim castles of prodigious strength, against which the
feeble engines and guns of those days hurled their
missiles with small effect. Some of these were royal
or quasi-royal property and looked to the Crown for
their defence. The majority, however, had to be
maintained and held by owners against the King&rsquo;s
enemies, subject to confiscation in case of any deficiency
in zeal or precaution. Ordinarily impregnable
though the walls were, the garrisons, as we shall
see, were mostly small, and they were incapable of
making much impression upon the surrounding
country when once it became openly hostile and
armed.</p>

<p>South Wales had as yet shown no great disposition
to move. Some riots and bloodshed at Abergavenny
had been almost the sum total of its patriotic activity.
Now, however, that the Dragon Standard was actually
floating on Plinlimmon and the already renowned
Owen, with a band of chosen followers, was calling
the South to arms, there was no lack of response.
The bards had been busy preparing the way on the
south as well as on the north of the Dovey. In the
words of Pennant:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;They animated the nation by recalling to mind the
great exploits of their ancestors, their struggles for
liberty, their successful contests with the Saxon and
Norman race for upwards of eight centuries. They rehearsed
the cruelty of their antagonists, and did not
forget the savage policy of the first Edward to their proscribed
brethren. They brought before their countrymen
the remembrance of ancient prophecies. They
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>144]</a></span>
showed the hero Glyndwr to be descended from the
ancient race of our Princes, and pronounced that in him
was to be expected the completion of our oracular Merlin.
The band of minstrels now struck up. The harp, the
&lsquo;crwth,&rsquo; and the pipe filled up the measure of enthusiasm
which the other had begun to inspire. They
rushed to battle, fearless of the event, like their great
ancestry, moved by the Druids&rsquo; songs, and scorned death
which conferred immortality in reward of their valour.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Glyndwr now fell with heavy hand upon this
southern country, crossing the headwaters of the
Severn and the Wye, and pressing hard upon the
Marches of Carmarthen. The common people rose
on every side and joined the forces that acted
either under his leadership or in his name. Those
who did not join him, as was certainly the case with
a majority of the upper class at this early period,
had to find refuge in the castles or to fly to safer
regions, leaving their property at the mercy of the
insurgents. But a battle was fought at the opening
of this campaign on the summit of Mynydd Hyddgant,
a hill in the Plinlimmon group, that did more,
perhaps, to rouse enthusiasm for Glyndwr than even
the strains of the bards or his own desolating marches.</p>

<p>The Flemings in Wales at that time were not confined
to Western Pembroke, but had still strong
colonies below Carmarthen, in the Glamorgan promontory
of Gower, and some footing in South
Cardiganshire. Whether they had actually felt the
hand of Glyndwr upon their borders, or whether they
deemed it better to take the initiative, they at any
rate collected a force of some fifteen hundred men,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>145]</a></span>
and marching northward to the Cardigan mountains,
surprised the Welsh leader as he was encamped on
the summit of Mynydd Hyddgant, with a body of
less than five hundred men around him. The
Flemish strategy was creditable, seeing that it was
carried out by slow-witted and slow-footed lowlanders
against nimble mountaineers and so astute a chieftain.
Owen found himself surrounded by a force thrice the
number of his own, and either death or capture
seemed inevitable. As the latter meant the former,
he was not long in choosing his course, and putting
himself at the head of his warriors he attacked the
Flemings with such fury that he and most of his
band escaped, leaving two hundred of their enemies
dead upon the mountain slope. This personal feat
of arms was worth five thousand men to Owen.
It was all that was wanted to fill the measure of his
prestige and decide every wavering Welshman in his
favour.</p>

<p>For this whole summer Glyndwr was fighting and
ravaging throughout South and Mid-Wales. The
lands of the English as well as of those Welshmen
who would not join him were ruthlessly harried.
Stock was carried off, homesteads were burned, even
castles here and there were taken, when ill-provisioned
and undermanned. New Radnor under Sir
John Grendor was stormed and the sixty defenders
hung upon the ramparts by way of encouragement
to others to yield. The noble abbey of Cwmhir
too, whose ruins still slowly crumble in a remote
Radnorshire valley, felt Glyndwr&rsquo;s pitiless hand, being
utterly destroyed. His animosity to the Church
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>146]</a></span>
was intelligible, though for his method of showing it
nothing indeed can be said. The Welsh Church,
though its personnel was largely native, was, with
the exception of the Franciscan order, mostly hostile
to Glyndwr and upon the side of the English Government.
Bards and priests, moreover, were irreconcilable
enemies. The latter had in some sort
usurped the position the former had once held, and
now the patron and the hero of the bards, who were
once more lifting up their heads, was not likely to be
acceptable to the clergy. This, however, would be
a poor excuse for an iconoclasm that would set a
Welsh torch to noble foundations built and endowed
for the most part with Welsh money.</p>

<p>Glyndwr in the meantime swept down the Severn
valley, burning on his way the small town of Montgomery,
and coming only to a halt where the border
borough of Welshpool lay nestling between the high
hills through which the Severn rushes out into the
fat plains of Shropshire.</p>

<p>The great Red Castle of Powys, then called
&ldquo;Pole,&rdquo; overlooked in those days, as it does in
these, the town it sheltered. The famous Shropshire
family of Charlton were then, and for generations
afterwards, its lords and owners. From its
walls Glyndwr and his forces were now driven back
by Edward Charlton with his garrison and the levies
of the neighbourhood, which remained throughout
the war staunch to its lord and the King. The repulse
of Owen, however, was not accomplished without
much hard fighting and the destruction of all
the suburbs of the town.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>147]</a></span>
But these sallies from castles and walled towns
could do little more than protect their inmates.
Mid-&nbsp;and South Wales literally bristled with feudal
castles containing garrisons of, for the most part, less
than a hundred men. These scattered handfuls were
unable to leave their posts and act in unison, and
when the abandonment of North Wales by Hotspur
gave further confidence to those who had risen, or
would like to rise, for Glyndwr, the greater part of
South Wales fell into line with the Centre and the
North. From the border to the sea Owen was now,
so far as the open country was concerned, irresistible.
Nor was it only within the bounds of Wales that
men who were unfriendly to Glyndwr had cause to
tremble. The rapid progress of his arms had already
spread terror along the border, and created something
like a panic even in England. The idea of a
Welsh invasion spread to comparatively remote
parts, and urgent letters carried by hard-riding messengers
went hurrying to the King from beleaguered
Marchers and scared abbots, beseeching him to come
in person to their rescue.</p>

<p>All this happened in August. As early as the
preceding June, when Conway was in Welsh hands,
the King had meditated a second invasion in person,
and had issued summonses to the sheriffs of fourteen
counties to meet him at Worcester, but the approaching
surrender of Conway and the optimistic
reports from Wales that met him as he came west
turned him from his purpose. There was no optimism
now; all was panic and the King was really coming.
The Prince of Wales in the meantime was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>148]</a></span>
ordered forward with the levies of the four border
counties, while the forces of twenty-two of the western,
southern, and midland shires were hurriedly collected
by a proclamation sent out upon the 18th of
September.</p>

<p>One reads with constant and unabated surprise of
the celerity with which these great levies gathered
from all parts of the country to the appointed tryst,
fully equipped and ready for a campaign. One&rsquo;s
amazement, however, is sensibly modified as the
narrative proceeds and discovers them after a week
or two of marching in an enemy&rsquo;s country reduced
to their last crust, upon the verge of disaster and
starvation, and leaving in their retiring tracks as
many victims as might have fallen in quite a sharp
engagement.</p>

<p>By the opening of October the King and Prince
Henry had entered Wales with a large army. The
proclamation of September the 18th, calling out the
forces of England, had stated that the greater part
of the able-bodied men of Wales had gone over to
Owen. Now, however, as this great host pushed its
way to Bangor, as had happened before, and would
happen again, not a Welshman was to be seen.
On every side were the sparse grain-fields long
stripped of their produce, the barns empty, the
abundant pastures bare of the small black cattle and
mountain sheep with which in times of peace and
safety they were so liberally sprinkled. On the 8th
of October the army was at Bangor, on the 9th at
Carnarvon, whose tremendous and impregnable fortress
John Bolde defended for the King with about a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>149]</a></span>
hundred men. Still seeing no sign of an enemy,
they swept in aimless fashion round the western
edges of the Snowdon mountains (for the route
through them, which was even then a recognised
one, would have been too dangerous), arriving in an
incredibly short space of time in Cardiganshire,
where the King called a halt at the great and historic
abbey of Ystradfflur or Strata Florida.</p>

<p>The weather for a wonder favoured the English,
and we might be excused for giving our imagination
play for a moment and painting in fancy the gorgeous
sight that the chivalry of half England, unsoiled
by time or tempests or war, with its glinting steel,
its gay colours, its flaunting pennons, shining in the
October sun, must have displayed as it wound in a
long, thin train through those familiar and matchless
scenes. The great Cistercian house of Ystradfflur
had shared with Conway in olden days the honour
of both making and preserving the records of the
Principality. Around the building was a cemetery
shaded by forty wide-spreading and venerable yew
trees. Beneath their shade lay the bones of eleven
Welsh Princes of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries
and perhaps those of the greatest Welsh poet of the
age, Dafydd ab Gwilim. Henry cared for none of
these things. He allowed the abbey to be gutted and
plundered, not sparing even the sacred vessels. He
turned the monks out on to the highway, under the
plea that two or three of them had favoured Owen,
and filled up the measure of desecration by stabling
his horses at the high altar.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Owen and his nimble troops began to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>150]</a></span>
show themselves in Cardiganshire, harrying the flanks
and rear and outposts of the royal army, cutting off
supplies, and causing much discomfort and considerable
loss, including the whole camp equipage of the
Prince of Wales.</p>

<p>Henry did his best to bring Owen to action, but
the Welsh chieftain was much too wary to waste his
strength on a doubtful achievement which hunger
would of a certainty accomplish for him within a few
days. An eminent gentleman of the country, one
Llewelyn ab Griffith Vychan of Cayo, comes upon
the scene at this point and at the expense of his
head relieves the tedium of this brief and ineffectual
campaign with a dramatic incident. His position,
we are told, was so considerable that he
consumed in his house no less than sixteen casks of
wine a year; but his patriotism rose superior to his
rank and comforts. He offered to guide the royal
troops to a spot where they might hope to capture
Owen, but instead of doing this he deliberately misled
them, to their great cost, and openly declared
that he had two sons serving with Glyndwr, and that
his own sympathies were with them and their heroic
leader. He then bared his neck to the inevitable
axe of the executioner, and proved himself thereby
to be a hero, whose name, one is glad to think, has
been rescued from oblivion.</p>

<p>The King, having attended to the mangling and
quartering of this gallant old patriot, crossed the
Montgomery hills with his army and hurried down
the Severn valley, carrying with him, according to
Adam of Usk, a thousand Welsh children as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>151]</a></span>
captives. Beyond this capture, he had achieved nothing
save some further harrying of a land already
sufficiently harried, and the pillaging of an historic
and loyal monastery.</p>

<p>Arriving at Shrewsbury before the end of October
he disbanded his army, leaving behind him a Wales
rather encouraged in its rebellious ways than otherwise,
Glyndwr&rsquo;s reputation in no whit diminished, and
his own and his Marchers&rsquo; castles as hardly pressed
and in as sore a plight as when he set out, with so
much pomp and circumstance, less than a month before.
It must have been merely to save appearances
that he issued a pardon to the &ldquo;Commons of Cardigan,&rdquo;
with leave to buy back the lands that had been
nominally confiscated. He was also good enough to
say that on consideration he would allow them to
retain their own language, which it seems he had
tabooed; this, too, at a time when the life of no Englishman
in Cardigan was safe a bowshot away from
the Norman castles, when the Welsh of the country
were practically masters of the situation and Glyndwr
virtually their Prince.</p>

<p>Still Henry meant well. Since he was their King,
his manifest duty was to reconquer their country for
the Crown, and this was practically the task that lay
before him. But then again this is precisely what he
did not seem for a long time yet to realise. He was
a good soldier, while for his energy and bodily
activity one loses oneself in admiration. But he persistently
underrated the Welsh position and gave his
mind and his energies to other dangers and other interests
which were far less pressing. And when he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>152]</a></span>
did bend his whole mind to the subjection of Glyndwr,
his efforts were ill-directed, and the conditions
seemed to be of a kind with which he not only could
not grapple but which his very soul abhorred. It
remained, as will be seen, for the gallant son, whose
frivolity is popularly supposed to have been the
bane of his father&rsquo;s life, by diligence as well as valour,
to succeed where the other had ignominiously
failed.</p>

<p>Lord Rutland was now appointed to the thorny
office of Governor of North Wales, while the Earl
of Worcester, a Percy and uncle to Hotspur, was
left to face Glyndwr in the southern portion of the
Principality. The winter of 1401-2 was at hand, a
season when Owen and his Welshmen could fight,
but English armies most certainly could not campaign.
The castles in the Southern Marches were
put in fighting trim, revictualled and reinforced.
The chief of those in the interior that Glyndwr had
now to face were Lampeter, Cardigan and Builth,
Llandovery and Carmarthen, while upon the border
the massive and high-perched towers of Montgomery
and Powys looked down over the still smoking villages
by the Severn&rsquo;s bank, and girded themselves to
stem if need be any repetition of such disaster.
Owen seemed to think that his presence in the
North after so long an absence would be salutary; so,
passing into Carnarvonshire, he appeared before its
stubborn capital.</p>

<p>But John Bolde had been reinforced with men and
money, and, joined by the burghers of the town, he
beat off Glyndwr&rsquo;s attack and slew three hundred of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>153]</a></span>
his men. This was early in November. All North
Wales but the castles and the walled towns around
them, where such existed, was still friendly to Owen.
The chief castles away from the English border,
Criccieth, Harlech, Carnarvon, Conway, Snowdon
(Dolbadarn), Rhuddlan, and Beaumaris, complete the
list of those in royal keeping and may be readily
reckoned up, unlike those of South Wales, whose
name was legion; while Denbigh and Ruthin were
the only Marcher strongholds, apart from those which
were in immediate touch with Salop and Cheshire.
Now it so happened that, before most of the events
narrated in this chapter had taken place, before, indeed,
Hotspur had retired in such seeming petulance
from North Wales during the preceding summer,
he had contrived a meeting with Glyndwr. The
scene of the interview is not known; that it occurred,
however, is not merely noted by the chroniclers, but
Glyndwr&rsquo;s attitude in connection with it is referred
to in the State papers. A council called in November,
while Owen was making his attempt on Carnarvon,
has upon its minutes, &ldquo;To know the king&rsquo;s
will about treaty with Glyndwr to return to his
allegiance seeing his good intentions relating thereto.&rdquo;
In the interview with Percy, Owen is said to
have declared that he was willing to submit, provided
that his life should be spared and his property guaranteed
to him. Later in the year, as a well-known
original letter of the period affirms, &ldquo;Jankyn Tyby
of the North Countre bringeth letteres owt of the
North Countre to Owen as thei demed from Hen<sup>r.</sup> son
Percy.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>154]</a></span>
In answer Owen expressed his affection for the
Earl of Northumberland and the confidence he felt
in him. The King was then informed of the proceedings,
and with his consent a messenger was sent
from Earl Percy to Mortimer, whose sister, as Hotspur&rsquo;s
wife, was his daughter-in-law. Through the
medium of Mortimer, soon to become so closely
allied to Glyndwr, the latter is reported to have declared
his willingness for peace, protesting that he
was not to blame for the havoc wrought in Wales,
and that he had been deprived of his patrimony,
meaning no doubt the northern slice of Glyndyfrdwy
which Grey, after being defeated at law, had annexed
by force, with connivance of the King&rsquo;s council.
He added that he would readily meet the Earl of
Northumberland on the English border, as was required
of him, but that he feared outside treachery
to his person, as a man who had made such a host
of enemies may well have done. He also declared
that, if he came to Shropshire, the Commons would
raise a clamour and say that he came to destroy all
those who spoke English. That Hotspur had seen
Glyndwr earlier in the summer is distinctly stated by
Hardyng, who was Hotspur&rsquo;s own page. The fact
that Percy did not take the opportunity to treacherously
seize the Welsh chieftain was afterwards
made one of the grievances urged by the King when
he had other really serious ones against his old
comrade. It may well, however, be suspected that
some of these mysterious overtures in which the
Percys and Mortimer figured so prominently contained
the germs of the alliance that followed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>155]</a></span>
later between Glyndwr and the two great English
houses.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<p class="caption">OLD BRIDGE AT LLANSANTFFRAID, GLYNDYFRDWY.</p>
</div>

<p>No such suspicions, however, were as yet in the
air, and Glyndwr retired, with his captains and his
bards, into winter quarters at Glyndyfrdwy. Here,
through the short days and long nights, the sounds
of song and revelry sounded in the ancient Welsh
fashion above the tumbling breakers of the Dee.
The very accessibility of the spot to the strong
border castles showed the reality at this time of
Owen&rsquo;s power. The great pile of Chirk was not a
dozen miles off, Dinas Br&acirc;n was within easy
sight, and the Arundels, who held them both, were no
less mighty than the Greys who lay amid the ashes
of Ruthin across the ridges to the north. But the
whole country towards England, to Wrexham upon
the one hand and to Oswestry on the other, and even
to Ellesmere and that detached fragment of Flint
known then as &ldquo;Maelor Saesnag,&rdquo; was in open or
secret sympathy with what had now become a
national movement. More men of note, too, and
property were with Owen this winter. The rising in
its origin had been markedly democratic. The
labour agitations that during the century just completed
had stirred England, had not left Wales untouched.
There, too, the times had changed for the
lower orders. The Norman heel pressed more
heavily upon them than it did upon their native
masters, who were often on friendly terms and connected
by marriage with the conquerors&rsquo; families,
while the very fact that Norman feudal customs had
grown so general made it harder for the poor. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>156]</a></span>
Welsh gentry as a class had hitherto fought somewhat
shy of the Dragon Standard. Many, especially
from South Wales, had fled to England. Now, however,
everyone outside the immediate shelter of the
castles had to declare himself for Owen or the King.
And at this moment there was not much choice,&mdash;for
those, at any rate, who set any store by their safety.</p>

<p>To make matters worse for Henry, the Scots had
again declared war in November, and in December
Glyndwr made a dash for the great stronghold of
Harlech. This was only saved to the King, for the
time being, by the timely despatch of four hundred
archers and one hundred men-at-arms from the
Prince of Wales&rsquo;s headquarters at Chester. Owen,
however, achieved this winter what must have been,
to himself at any rate, a more satisfactory success than
even the taking of Harlech, and this was the capture
of his old enemy, Reginald, Lord Grey of Ruthin.</p>

<p>It was on the last day of January, according to
Adam of Usk, that Glyndwr crossed the wild hills
dividing his own territory from that of Grey, and,
dropping down into the Vale of Clwyd, appeared before
Ruthin. There are several versions of this
notable encounter. All point to the fact that Owen
exercised some strategy in drawing his enemy, with
the comparatively small force at his command, out
of his stronghold, and then fell on him with overpowering
numbers.</p>

<p>An old tale recounts that the Welsh leader drove
a number of stakes into the ground in a wooded
place and caused his men to hang their helmets
on them to represent a small force, while the men
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>157]</a></span>
themselves lurked in ambush upon either side; and
that he caused the shoes of his horses to be reversed
to make Grey think that he had retreated.
The fight took place, according to one tradition, close
to Ruthin; another declares that Brynsaithmarchog
(&ldquo;the hill of the seven knights&rdquo;), half way to Corwen,
was the scene of it. But this is of little moment
to other than local antiquaries. Grey&rsquo;s force was
surrounded and cut to pieces; that haughty baron
himself was taken prisoner, and carried off at once,
with a view to making so notable a captive secure
against all attempt at rescue, to the Snowdon mountains.
The tables were indeed turned on the greedy
and tyrannical Lord Marcher who had been the primary
cause of all this trouble that had fallen upon
Wales and England. Glyndwr would not have been
human had he not then drained to the last drop the
cup of a revenge so sweet, and Grey was immured in
the castle of Dolbadarn, whose lonely tower, still
standing between the Llanberis lakes and at the
foot of Snowdon, is so familiar to the modern tourist.
His treatment as a prisoner, amid the snows of
those cold mountains, was not indulgent, if his
friends in England are to be believed. But such a
captive was too valuable to make experiments upon
in the matter of torture or starvation. Owen regarded
him as worth something more than his weight
in gold, and gold was of infinite value to his cause.
So he proceeded to assess Grey&rsquo;s ransom at the formidable
sum of ten thousand marks, no easy amount
for even the greater barons of that time to realise.</p>

<p>The King was greatly distressed when he heard of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>158]</a></span>
his favourite&rsquo;s fate and pictured him as chained to
the wall in some noisome dungeon in the heart of
those dreary mountains, at the thought of which he
shuddered. Rescue was impossible, for the very
frontiers of Wales defied him, while the heart of
Snowdonia, the natural fortress of the Welsh nation,
was at that time almost as far beyond the reach of
his arm as Greenland; moreover he had the Scots
just now upon his hands.</p>

<p>Grey&rsquo;s captivity lasted nearly a year. Greatly
concerned in the matter though the King was, it was
not till the following October that he appointed a
commission to treat with Glyndwr for his favourite&rsquo;s
ransom. This commission consisted of Sir William
de Roos, Sir Richard de Grey, Sir William de Willoughby,
Sir William de Zouche, Sir Hugh Hals,
and six other less distinguished people. Glyndwr
agreed to release his prisoner in consideration of
ten thousand marks, six thousand to be paid
within a month, and hostages, in the person of
his eldest son and others, to be delivered to him
as guaranty for the remaining four thousand.
The Bishop of London and others were then
ordered to sell the manor of Hertleigh in Kent, and
Grey was to be excused for six years from the burdensome
tax then laid on absentee Irish landowners
amounting to one-third of their rentals. These payments
left him, we are told, a poor man for life. His
Ruthin property had been destroyed by Glyndwr
himself, and the latter&rsquo;s triumph was complete when
the Lord Marcher had to make a humiliating agreement
not to bear arms against him for the rest of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>159]</a></span>
his life. Hardyng, the rhyming chronicler, does not
omit this notable incident:</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>An unfounded, as well as quite improbable, tradition
has found its way into many accounts, which
represents Owen as compelling Grey to marry one
of his daughters.</p>

<p>While these stirring events were taking place,
Glyndwr&rsquo;s thoughts and his correspondence were
busy travelling oversea. He was sending letters
both to the King of Scotland and the native chieftains
of Ireland, soliciting their aid. At this time,
too, a certain knight of Cardiganshire named David
ap Tevan Goy, who for twenty years had been
fighting against the Saracens, with various Eastern
Christians, was sent on Owen&rsquo;s behalf by the King
of France to the King of Scotland. He was captured,
however, by English sailors and imprisoned
in the Tower of London.</p>

<p>Glyndwr&rsquo;s own messengers were equally unfortunate,
for letters he sent to Robert of Scotland and
the Irish chieftains were seized in Ireland and their
bearers beheaded. Adam of Usk has fortunately
left us a copy of them. Glyndwr had as yet no
chancellor or secretary at his side that we know of.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>160]</a></span>
And, indeed, being a man of the world and a well-educated
one, it may safely be assumed that he
wrote these letters himself. We have so little from
his own hand; his personality is in some respects so
vague and shadowy; his deeds and their results comprise
such a vast deal more of the material from
which the man himself has to be judged than is
usually the case, that one feels disinclined to omit
the smallest detail which brings him, as an individual,
more distinctly to the mind. I shall therefore
insert the whole text of the captured letters.
The first is to the King of Scotland, the second to
the lords of Ireland.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Most high and Mighty and redoubted Lord and
Cousin, I commend me to your most High and Royal
Majesty, humbly as it beseemeth me with all honour and
reverence. Most redoubted Lord and Sovereign Cousin,
please it you and your most high Majesty to know that
Brutus, your most noble ancestor and mine, which was
the first crowned King who dwelt in this realm of England,
which of old times was called Great Britain. The
which Brutus begat three sons; to wit, Albanact, Locrine,
and Camber, from which same Albanact you are
descended in direct line. And the issue of the same
Camber reigned loyally down to Cadwalladar, who was
the last crowned King of the people, and from whom I,
your simple Cousin am descended in direct line; and
after whose decease, I and my ancestors and all my said
people have been and still are, under the tyranny and
bondage of mine and your mortal enemies, the Saxons;
whereof you most redoubted Lord and very Sovereign
Cousin, have good knowledge. And from this tyranny
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>161]</a></span>
and bondage the prophecy saith that I shall be delivered
by the help and succour of your Royal Majesty. But
most redoubted Lord and Sovereign Cousin, I make a
grievous plaint to your Royal Majesty, and most Sovereign
Cousinship, that it faileth me much in soldiers,
therefore most redoubted Lord and very Sovereign
Cousin, I humbly beseech you kneeling upon my knees,
that it may please your Royal Majesty to send me a certain
number of soldiers, who may aid me and withstand,
with God&rsquo;s help, mine and your enemies, having regard
most redoubted Lord and very Sovereign Cousin to the
chastisement of this mischief and of all the many past
mischiefs which I and my ancestors of Wales have suffered
at the hands of mine and your mortal enemies.
And be it understood, most redoubted Lord and very
Sovereign Cousin that I shall not fail all the days of my
life to be bounden to do your service and to repay you.
And in that I cannot send unto you all my business in
writing, I send these present bearers fully informed in all
things, to whom be pleased to give faith and belief in
what they shall say to you by word of mouth. From
my Court, most redoubted Lord and very Sovereign
Cousin, may the Almighty Lord have you in his keeping.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The letter to the Irish lords runs thus:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Health and fulness of love most dread Lord
and most trusty Cousin. Be it known unto you
that a great discord or war hath arisen between
us and our and your deadly enemies, the Saxons;
which war we have manfully waged now for nearly
two years past, and henceforth mean and hope to
wage and carry out to a good and effectual end, by
the grace of God our Saviour, and by your help and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>162]</a></span>
countenance. But seeing that it is commonly reported
by the prophecy, that before we can have the upper hand
in this behalf, you and yours, our well beloved Cousins in
Ireland must stretch forth thereto a helping hand, therefore
most dread Lord and trusty Cousin, with heart and
soul we pray you that of your horse and foot soldiers,
for the succour of us and our people who now this long
while are oppressed by our enemies and yours, as well as
to oppose the treacherous and deceitful will of those
same enemies, you despatch to us as many as you shall
be able with convenience and honour, saving in all
things your honourable State, as quickly as may seem
good to you. Delay not to do this by the love we bear
you and as we put our trust in you, although we be unknown
to you, seeing that, most dread Lord and Cousin,
so long as we shall be able to manfully wage this war
in our borders, as doubtless is dear to you, you and all
the other Chiefs of your land of Ireland will in the meantime
have welcome peace and calm repose. And because,
my Lord Cousin, the bearers of these presents
shall make things known to you more fully by word of
mouth, if it please you, you shall give credence to them
in all things which they shall say to you on our behalf,
and you may trustfully confide to them whatsoever you
will, dread Lord and Cousin, that we your poor cousin
shall do. Dread Lord and Cousin, may the Almighty
preserve your reverence and Lordship in long life and
good fortune.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Written in North Wales on the twenty-ninth day of
November [1401].&rdquo;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V<br />
<br />
<span class="vsmlfont">THE KING AND HOTSPUR<br />
1402</span></h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>S if the world of Britain were not already sufficiently
excited, the spring of 1402 opened
with tremendous portents. In the month of
February a comet with its fiery streaming tail, &ldquo;a terror
to the world,&rdquo; broke across the heavens and set all
Europe trembling. The bards of Wales rose with
one voice to the occasion, headed by Iolo Goch, who
recalled the fiery star that heralded the birth of
Arthur, and even that other one which guided the
Magi to our Saviour&rsquo;s cradle.</p>

<p>The fiery shapes, too, that &ldquo;lit the front of heaven&rdquo;
at Owen&rsquo;s birth were recalled again with a fresh outburst
of enthusiasm, and the tail of this particular
comet, which Adam of Usk saw by day as well as by
night, while travelling towards Rome, curled up at
times, in the eyes of credulous Welsh patriots, into a
dragon&rsquo;s shape, the badge of Welsh nationality.
Englishmen beheld it pointing at one time towards
Wales, at another towards Scotland, and read in
these mysterious changes portents for the coming
year. Thunder-storms of terrific violence swept over
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>164]</a></span>
the country. At Danbury, says Holinshed, while
the people were in church, lightning struck the roof
and destroyed the chancel, and while the storm was
at its height the devil entered the sacred building,
dressed as a Franciscan friar (one of Owen&rsquo;s well-wishers,
it will be remembered), and leaped three
times over the altar from right to left; then, turning
black in the face, he rushed down the aisle, actually
passing between a man&rsquo;s legs, and leaving an overpowering
smell of sulphur in his track. The man&rsquo;s
legs were black ever after, so that there was no
doubt about the nature of the visitant! Other weird
things happened in various parts of the country,
which do not concern our story, except to show how
strained were men&rsquo;s imaginations in a year which
after all proved fruitful enough of events.</p>

<p>Whatever faith Owen may have had in his own
magical art, he at any rate did not waste time just
now in incantations or in interpreting the prophecy,
but swept down the Vale of Clwyd, making on his
way a final clearance of Grey&rsquo;s desolated property.
With much significance, read by the light of his
future relations with the Mortimers and Percys, he
spared the lordship of Denbigh, though its owners
were still his open enemies. Descending the Vale,
however, he fell upon Saint Asaph with merciless
hand, destroying the cathedral, the bishop&rsquo;s palace,
and the canon&rsquo;s house. Trevor was at this time the
bishop,&mdash;the same, it will be remembered, who
warned Henry and his council against exasperating
Owen and the Welsh; he had from the first gone
over to the new King, had prominently assisted at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>165]</a></span>
the deposition of Richard, and had since held many
conspicuous offices. He was now a ruined man, an
enforced exile from his diocese, and he must have
derived but poor consolation from reminding his
English friends of the accuracy of his prophecy. He
came of the great border House of Trevor, and,
among other things, built the first stone bridge in
Wales, which may yet be seen stemming with five
massive arches the turbulent torrents of the Dee at
Llangollen. In the meantime he was a pensioner on
the King, but he will appear later in a character of
quite another sort. An entry of &pound;66, paid to him
at this time in lieu of his losses, appears on the Pell
Rolls.</p>

<p>No danger just now threatened from the
English border nor, on the other hand, did any help
come to Glyndwr from Ireland or the North. There
was indeed something of a lull in Wales throughout
this spring, unless perhaps for those unfortunate
Welshmen who held back from Glyndwr&rsquo;s cause
and yet ventured to remain in the country. They,
at any rate, had not much peace.</p>

<p>To this date is assigned the well-known story of
Glyndwr and his cousin Howel Sele, that gruesome
tragedy which has invested the romantic heights of
Nannau with a ceaseless interest to generations of
tourists, and many more generations of Welshmen,
and has seized the fancy of the romancist and the
poet. Now Nannau, where Vaughans have lived for
many centuries, enjoys the distinction of being the
most elevated country-seat in Wales, being some
eight hundred feet above Dolgelly, which lies at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>166]</a></span>
the base of the beautiful grounds that cover the
isolated hill on whose summit the present mansion
stands. It is famous also, even in a region pre-eminent
for its physical charms, for the surpassing beauty
of its outlook, which people from every part of Britain
come annually in thousands to enjoy. To the
south the great mass of Cader Idris rises immediately
above, with infinite grandeur. To the west
the Barmouth estuary gleams seaward through a
vista of wood and mountain. To the north the
valley of the rushing Mawddach opens deep into the
hills, while to the eastward, where the twin peaks of
the Arans fill the sky, spread those miles of foliage
through which the crystal streams of the Wnion
come burrowing and tumbling seawards. Nature
showed even a wilder aspect to Glyndwr and the
then lord of Nannau as they took their memorable
walk together upon these same heights five centuries
ago.</p>

<p>At that time there stood in the meadows beneath,
near the confluence of the Wnion and the Mawddach,
the noble abbey of Cymmer, whose remains
are still a conspicuous object in the landscape.
Howel Sele was by no means an admirer or follower
of his cousin Owen, and if latterly he had not dared
openly to oppose him, he had at least held back; his
relationship to the chief alone saving him, no doubt,
from the punishment meted out to others who were
less prudent, or less faint-hearted. The worthy abbot
of Cymmer, however, for some motive of his own,
or perhaps in a genuine spirit of Christianity, endeavoured
to promote a better understanding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>167]</a></span>
between the relatives, and so far succeeded that Owen
consented to come and visit Howel in peaceful
fashion, bringing with him only a few attendants.</p>

<p class="caption">LOOKING UP THE MAWDDACH FROM NANNAU.</p>
</div>

<p>The meeting took place and an amicable understanding
seemed assured. During the course of the
day the two men, so runs the tale, went for a stroll
in the park, Howel, at any rate, carrying his bow.
He was celebrated for his prowess as a marksman,
and Owen, catching sight of a buck through the
trees, suggested that his cousin should give him an
exhibition of his skill. Howel, falling in apparently
with the proposal, bent his bow, and having feigned
for a moment to take aim at the deer swung suddenly
round and discharged the arrow full at Owen&rsquo;s
breast. The latter, either from singular forethought
or by great good luck, happened to have a shirt of
mail beneath his tunic, and the shaft fell harmlessly
to the ground. The fate of Howel was swift and
terrible. Accounts differ somewhat, but they all
agree in the essential fact that neither his wife and
family nor his friends ever set eyes upon the lord of
Nannau again. It is supposed that the two men
and their attendants forthwith engaged in deadly
combat, Glyndwr proving the victor, and consigning
his cousin to some terrible fate that was only guessed
at long afterwards. In any case, he at once burnt
the old house at Nannau to the ground, and its
remains, Pennant tells us, were yet there in his day,&mdash;a
hundred years ago. For more than a generation
no man knew what had become of the ill-fated
Howel, but forty years afterwards, near the spot
where he was last seen, a skeleton corresponding to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>168]</a></span>
the proportions of the missing man was found inside
a hollow oak tree, and it is said that there were
those still living who could and did explain how the
vanquished Howel had been immured there dead or
alive by Glyndwr. The old oak lived on till the
year 1813, and collapsed beneath its weight of years
on a still July night, a few hours after it had been
sketched by the celebrated antiquary, Sir Richard
Colt Hoare, who tells us it then measured twenty-seven
feet in girth. It had been an object of pious
horror for all time to the natives of the district, and
was known as the &ldquo;hollow oak of demons,&rdquo; and
dread sounds were heard issuing from its vast trunk
by all who were hardy enough to venture near it
after nightfall. Sir Walter Scott, who once visited
Nannau, remembered the weird story and the
haunted oak when he was writing <i>Marmion</i>:</p>

</div>

<p>But while Glyndwr was having things pretty much
his own way in Wales throughout the spring of 1402,
King Henry was in truth in great anxiety. To add
to his cares and trouble he was much concerned with
endeavours to secure a husband for his daughter
Blanche, and a wife for himself in the person of
Joanna of Brittany. For the lavish expenditure inseparable
from these royal alliances he had to
squeeze his people, and they were in no condition
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>169]</a></span>
to be squeezed, to say nothing of the fact that his
captains and soldiers and garrisons in Wales were
in a state of pecuniary starvation, and here and
there in actual want of food. All this awakened
much discontent and there were serious riots in
many places. A plot of which the friars, chiefly
represented by Glyndwr&rsquo;s friends the Franciscans,
were the leaders, was discovered and crushed with
much hanging and quartering. Even Henry&rsquo;s loyal
subjects of London turned mutinous and their juries
refused to convict the priests. The aid, however, of
a packed jury in Islington was invoked, who excused
themselves for some manifestly outrageous decisions
with the na&iuml;ve but unanswerable plea that if they did
not hang the prisoners they would be hanged themselves.
The report was still sedulously bruited
abroad that Richard was alive, and, if anything, the
idea gained ground; while, to complete the distress
of the King, the Scots were waging open war upon
him in the North, and proving perhaps better allies
to Glyndwr than if they had responded to that warrior&rsquo;s
appeals and landed in scattered bands upon
the coast of Wales. The Percys, however, the
King&rsquo;s &ldquo;faithful cousins,&rdquo; confronted the Scots
and were a host in themselves. He despatched his
daughter Blanche and her hardly extracted dower
to Germany, and a terrible example was made of
the friars. Glyndwr and the condition of Wales one
can hardly suppose he underestimated, but he permitted
himself, at any rate, to shut his eyes to it.</p>

<p>Henry&rsquo;s dream, since mounting the throne, had
been an Eastern crusade. So far, however, his own
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>170]</a></span>
unruly subjects and neighbours had allowed him but
little breathing time, and he had been splashed with
the mud of almost every county in England and
Wales; but now he had gone to Berkhampstead, his
favourite palace, to rest and dream of that long-cherished
scheme of Eastern adventure.</p>

<div class="cpoem25">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;So shaken as we are, so wan with care,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Find we a time for frighted peace to pant,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And breathe short-winded accents of new broils<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To be commenced in strands afar remote.<br /></span>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But the month of June was not yet out, when all
at once there came upon the King at Berkhampstead
&ldquo;a post from Wales laden with heavy news,&rdquo; which
shattered all dreams of Palestine and turned his unwilling
thoughts once more to the stormy hills
whence came this urgent message.</p>

<p>Late in May, Glyndwr had again left North Wales
and with a large force made his way through the
present counties of Montgomery and Radnor, and
fallen on the as yet unravaged border of Hereford.
Now it so happened that among the districts which
here suffered the most were those belonging to the
young Earl of March, the rightful heir to the throne,
and on that account kept secure under lock and key
by Henry. This child, for he was nothing more,
was descended from Lionel, Duke of Clarence, third
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>171]</a></span>
son of Edward the Third. His title to the throne
stood next to that of Richard, who had himself
officially named him as his heir. Henry, sensible of
his dangerous claim, kept the boy and his brother
under his own charge, leaving their estates in Denbigh
and the South Wales Marches to be administered
by their uncle, Edmund Mortimer, who was
still a young man and not without renown as a
soldier. Mortimer and other Lord Marchers had
been notified in good time to raise the forces of the
border counties and march out to meet the Welsh.</p>

<p>They met upon the border in a narrow valley at
Pilleth near Knighton, and the result was wholly
disastrous to the English. The Welsh on this occasion
were led by Rhys ap Gethin, one of Owen&rsquo;s most
formidable captains, and they utterly overthrew
Mortimer&rsquo;s army, driving it down the narrow valley
of the Lugg below Pilleth hill where escape was
difficult, and slaying eleven hundred men, among
whom were great numbers of knights and gentlemen.
Mortimer himself was captured, and it was
said, with how much truth does not appear evident,
that many of Mortimer&rsquo;s troops, who were his
tenants, and Welshmen, turned their arms against
their own side and made a bloody day still bloodier.
The story of the outrages of the Welsh women upon
the bodies of the slain is a familiar topic of dispute
and not a very savoury one.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> In regard to Owen&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>172]</a></span>
new captive, Mortimer, as the uncle and representative
of the rightful heir to the throne, he was of
much more actual importance than Grey of Ruthin.
But the Welsh chieftain had no personal grudge
against the handsome and gallant young soldier who
had fallen into his hands by the ordinary fortune of
war. Indeed, as we know, he had a kindly feeling
for the Percys and the Mortimers; so much so that
some of the King&rsquo;s most ardent friends, as well as
Henry himself, strongly hinted that Sir Edmund
was no unwilling prisoner, and that it was not wholly
the chances of war which had placed him in Owen&rsquo;s
hands. Mortimer&rsquo;s relations with Glyndwr later on
might lend plausibility to such suggestions; but it is
difficult to suppose that had the former wished
earlier for an alliance with Owen, he would have
chosen such an unnecessarily bloody and risky manner
of effecting it. Moreover Henry had reason to
misrepresent Mortimer&rsquo;s sentiments, for the question
of the hour was his ransom. There can, I think, be
little doubt that Mortimer was at first as unwilling a
prisoner as Grey. He and Owen may have soon
developed a personal liking for each other, but that
is of little importance. Mortimer at any rate seems
to have been sent to Snowdon, or possibly to Owen&rsquo;s
small prison at Llansantffraid in Glyndyfrdwy, which
totters even now in extreme decay upon the banks
of the Dee; and ransom no doubt was regarded as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>173]</a></span>
the ordinary outcome of the affair by all parties,
except the King. For it soon became evident that
Henry, not unwilling to see a possible rival in
durance vile and safe out of the way, was going to
oppose all overtures for his ransom.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_8_8" id="Footnote_8_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8_8"><span class="label">[8]</span></a>
Some thirty years ago the farmers of the district drove their
ploughs into the old sod which from time immemorial had covered
the long, steep slope of Pilleth hill, or Bryn Gl&acirc;s. In turning it up
they came upon masses of human bones all collected in one spot,
which indicated without a doubt the burying-place of the battle of
1402. The space was withdrawn from cultivation and a grove of
trees was planted on it, which have now grown to a large size and
form a prominent object in the valley. <a href="#FNanchor_8_8">Back</a></p>
</div>

<p>Hotspur, Mortimer&rsquo;s brother-in-law, waxed hot
and angry, as of late he had been apt to do with the
King, but he was far away in the North looking
after the Scottish invaders. He now wrote to Henry
that it was a strange thing, seeing the great concern
he had showed for Grey of Ruthin, that he should
act thus towards a subject who was of even greater
consequence, and moreover his (Percy&rsquo;s) brother-in-law.
Getting no satisfaction, according to Leland,
who quotes from an old chronicle, the fiery Hotspur
went southward himself to Henry and demanded in
no gentle terms the right to ransom his wife&rsquo;s
brother. To this demand the King replied that he
would not strengthen those who were his enemies
by paying money to them. Hotspur retorted
warmly &ldquo;that the King owed it to those who had
risked their lives upon his account, to come to their
aid when in peril.&rdquo; The King rejoined angrily,
&ldquo;You are a traitor; you would succour the enemies
of myself and my kingdom.&rdquo; &ldquo;I am no traitor,&rdquo;
said Percy, &ldquo;but faithful and speak in good faith.&rdquo;
The King then drew his sword; whereupon Hotspur,
exclaiming, &ldquo;Not here, but on the field of
battle,&rdquo; left the royal presence, as it happened,
for ever.</p>

<p>This famous interview is practically endorsed by
the rhymer Hardyng, Hotspur&rsquo;s personal attendant:</p>

<div class="cpoem24">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>174]</a></span>
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Sir Henry sawe no grace for Mortimer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His wife&rsquo;s brother; he went away unkende<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Berwyk so, and after came no nere,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Afore thei met at Shrowesbury in fere<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wher then thei fought for cause of his extent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He purposed had Mortimer his coronement.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Hardyng in the preceding verse gives two other
reasons for the defection of the Percys, and though
our story has not yet reached that notable crisis, the
lines may perhaps be quoted here:</p>

<div class="cpoem24">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;The King hym blamed for he toke not Owen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When he came to him on his assurance,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he answered then to the King again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He might not so kepe his affiaunce,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To shame himself, with such a variaunce<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The King blamed him for his prisoner,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Th&rsquo; Erle Douglas, for cause he was not there.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This distinct statement from such an authority
that Hotspur had met Glyndwr, referring of course
to the previous year in Wales, should be conclusive,
though it is not creditable to Henry&rsquo;s honour that
he should throw in Hotspur&rsquo;s face the fact of his
having failed to act treacherously towards the
Welshman. The reference to the Earl of Douglas
will become plain shortly.</p>

<p>The victory of Pilleth had caused great enthusiasm
among the Welsh, and made a particularly marked
impression upon the southern and south-eastern districts,
where the Norman baronial houses were
strong, and where even the Welsh &ldquo;gentiles&rdquo; had
by no means as yet given an eager welcome to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>175]</a></span>
Owen&rsquo;s dragon standard with its accompaniment of
flaming torches and pitiless spears. Hundreds of
hitherto half-hearted Welshmen now joined Glyndwr,
who, flushed with victory and strong in its
prestige, turned fiercely upon Glamorgan and went
plundering, burning, and ravaging his way through
that fair county, taking little reck of the score or
two of Norman castles so strong in defence but at
this time so powerless for offence. He fell on Cardiff
and destroyed the whole town, saving only the
street where stood a religious house of his friends,
or at any rate Henry&rsquo;s enemies, the Franciscans.
Turning eastward he then sacked and burnt the
bishop&rsquo;s palace at Llandaff, stormed Abergavenny
Castle, and destroyed the town.</p>

<p>Leaving his friends to hold the country he had so
effectually roused, we next find him in the North,
investing the three castles of Carnarvon, Harlech,
and Criccieth, and reminding those who in his
absence may have faltered in their allegiance that
such an attitude was a costly one. Rhys and William
ap Tudor from the small stone manor-house in
Anglesey that gave a dynasty to Britain are with
him again, though the latter, it will be remembered,
had sought and gained at Conway the pardon of the
King. Robert ap Meredydd of Cefn-y-fan and
Gesail-Gyferch near Criccieth, was another trusty
henchman of Glyndwr. But Robert&rsquo;s brother Ievan
ap Meredydd stood for the King, and was one of the
few men in West Carnarvonshire who did so. He
was now in Carnarvon Castle, joint governor with
John Bolde, and his brother was outside with Owen,&mdash;a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>176]</a></span>
little bit of family detail for which, though of
no great importance, one is thankful amid the bloody
and fiery chaos in which such a vast amount of personality
lies forgotten and ingulfed.</p>

<p>It was not long after this that Ievan died in Carnarvon,
but so completely occupied was the surrounding
country by Owen&rsquo;s forces and sympathisers, that
they had to bring his body round by sea to his old
home and bury it secretly in his own parish church
of Penmorfa, where his dust still lies. His brother
Robert, though he held by Glyndwr throughout
most of his long struggle, eventually received the
royal pardon, and succeeded to the estates. But
even his attachment to the Welsh chieftain had not
in any way atoned for his brother&rsquo;s opposition, or
averted the inevitable fate which overtook the property
of all Glyndwr&rsquo;s opponents. Both Cefn-y-fan
and Gesail-Gyferch were burnt this year to ashes.
At the former the conflagration was so prodigious,
says an old local legend, that the ruins smoked and
the coals glowed for two whole years afterwards.
Gesail-Gyferch was rebuilt by Robert and may be
seen to-day, much as he made it, between the villages
of Penmorfa and Dolbenmaen. Its owner,
when the war was over, married, and had a host of
children, from whom innumerable Welsh families are
proud to trace their descent. If this gossip about
the sons of Meredydd and about Howel Sele may
seem too parenthetical, it serves in some sort to
illustrate the severance of families and the relentless
vengeance which Glyndwr himself executed upon all
who opposed him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>177]</a></span>
In the meantime, while Glyndwr was besieging the
castles upon the Carnarvon and Merioneth coast, his
great opponent Henry was being sorely pressed. The
battle of Pilleth and Mortimer&rsquo;s captivity had raised a
storm among those who had been the King&rsquo;s friends,
and worse things seemed in the air. Prince Thomas,
his second son, who was acting as viceroy in Ireland,
was reduced by want of money to sore straits, while
forty thousand Scotsmen, with numerous French
allies in their train, were far outnumbering any
forces the Percys unaided could bring against them.
But with all this the King was burning to crush
Owen and chastise the Welsh, and it was from no
want of will or vigour that he had for so many weeks
to nurse his wrath. Richard, Earl de Grey, had been
left in charge of the South Wales Marches, while the
Earl of Arundel was doing his best to keep order
north of the Severn. On July 23rd the King was at
Lilleshall, in Shropshire. Provisions, arms, and men
were pouring into Welshpool, Ludlow, and Montgomery,
Hereford, Shrewsbury, and Chester. Money
was scarcer than ever, and had to be borrowed in
every direction from private individuals. Henry himself
was riding restlessly from Shropshire to Lincoln,
from Lincoln to Nottingham, and again from Nottingham
to his favourite post of observation at
Lichfield.</p>

<p>At last all was ready; the reduction of Wales was
for once the paramount object of the King&rsquo;s intentions.
Three great armies were to assemble on August
the 27th at Chester, Shrewsbury, and Hereford
under the commands of the Prince of Wales, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>178]</a></span>
King himself, and the Earl of Warwick respectively.
After much delay this mighty host, numbering in all
by a general consensus of authorities one hundred
thousand men, prepared to set itself in motion.</p>

<p>It was the first week of September when it crossed
the border. The troops carried with them fifteen
days&rsquo; provisions, a precaution much exceeding the ordinary
commissariat limitations of those times, but
prompted by the bitter memories of three futile and
painful campaigns, and more than ever necessary owing
to the devastated condition of Wales. With such
an army, led by the King himself, England might
well think that the Welsh troubles were at an end.</p>

<p>Owen&rsquo;s character as a magician had been firmly
established this long time in Wales. His power of
eluding the King&rsquo;s armies, to say nothing of his
occasional victories, and still more of the way in
which the elements had seemed to fight for him, had
given him even throughout England something of a
reputation for necromancy. The practical mind of
Henry himself had been disturbed by the strange
rumours that had reached him, coupled with his own
experiences of that implacable and irrepressible foe
who claimed the power of &ldquo;calling spirits from the
vasty deep,&rdquo; and of being outside &ldquo;the roll of common
men.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If the English had hitherto only half believed that
Owen was a wizard, they were in less than a week
convinced that he was the very devil himself, against
whom twice their hundred thousand men would be
of slight avail. Never within man&rsquo;s memory had
there been such a September in the Welsh mountains.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>179]</a></span>
The very heavens themselves seemed to descend
in sheets of water upon the heads of these
magnificent and well-equipped arrays. Dee, Usk,
and Wye, with their boisterous tributaries that
crossed the English line of march, roared bank-high,
and buried all trace of the fords beneath volumes
of brown tumbling water, while bridges, homesteads,
and such flocks as the Welsh had not driven westward
for safety were carried downwards to the sea.
In these days of rapid travel it seems incredible that
so overwhelming and, for the times, well-found a
host, could be beaten in less than a fortnight without
striking a blow. It is an object-lesson in medieval
warfare worth taking to heart and remembering.
Night after night the soldiers lay in the open,
drenched to the skin, and half starved on account
of the havoc wrought upon their provisions by the
weather. The thunder roared, we are told, with
fearful voice and the lightning flashed against inky
skies, above the heads of that shivering, superstitious
host, at the will, it seemed to them, of the magic
wand of the accursed Glyndwr. Numbers died from
exposure. The royal tent was blown flat, and Henry
himself only escaped severe injury by being at the
moment in full armour.</p>

<p>The King, Hardyng tells us,</p>

<div class="cpoem25">

<p>How far the English armies penetrated on this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>180]</a></span>
memorable occasion we do not know; but we do
know that by the 22nd of September, just a fortnight
after they had first crossed the border, there was not
an Englishman in Wales outside the castles, while
the King himself, a day or two later, was actually
back at Berkhampstead, striving, in the domestic
seclusion of his own palace, to forget the unspeakable
miseries of his humiliating failure. Where Owen
distributed his forces through this tempestuous September,
there is no evidence; except that, following
the inevitable tactics of his race before great invasions,
he certainly retired with his forces into the
mountains. It was not even necessary on this occasion
to fall upon the retreating enemy. But when
one reads of the Welsh retiring to the mountains,
the natural tendency to think of them huddling
among rocks and caves must be resisted. The
Welsh mountains, even the loftiest, in those days
were very thickly sprinkled with oak forests, and in
the innumerable valleys and foot-hills there was
splendid pasture for large herds of stock. There
must have been plenty of dwellings, too, among these
uplands, and the Welsh were adepts at raising temporary
shelters of stone thatched with heather.</p>

<p>Owen now might well be excused if he really began
to think himself chosen of the gods. At any rate
he was justified in the proud boast that Shakespeare
at this time puts into his mouth:</p>

<div class="cpoem26">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Three times hath Henry Bolingbroke made head<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against my power. Thrice from the banks of Wye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sandy-bottomed Severn have I sent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Him bootless home, and weather-beaten back.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>181]</a></span>
Shakespeare is accurate enough so far, but he is
sadly astray when he makes the news of Mortimer&rsquo;s
capture and the defeat of Pilleth reach Henry upon
the same day as the victory of Percy over the Scots
at Homildon. The former was fought in the previous
June, whereas the latter took place while
Henry was in the very throes of his struggle with
the Welsh elements and Owen&rsquo;s art magic. In fact
the news of the crushing defeat of the Scots reached
him at the moment of his arrival at home, after his
disastrous campaign, and might well have afforded
him much consolation, unless perchance the contrast
between his own luckless campaign and that of Hotspur
tempered his joy and galled his pride.</p>

<p>This same battle of Homildon, or Humbledon,
near Wooler, exercised considerable influence upon
the affairs of Owen. I have already remarked that
forty thousand Scots, having with them many French
knights and gentlemen, were across the border. They
were commanded by Earl Douglas, who had most
of the chivalry and nobility of Scotland at his back.
There was no particular excuse for the invasion; it
was a marauding expedition, pure and simple, on an
immense scale, and it swept through Northumberland
and Durham almost unopposed, for the forces of
Percy were too inadequate for even his venturous
spirit to offer battle.</p>

<p>Laden with the spoils of two counties the Scots
turned their faces homeward entirely satisfied with
their luck. Unfortunately for them, they elected to
divide their forces, ten thousand men, including the
commander and all the choice spirits of the army,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>182]</a></span>
taking a separate route. As these latter approached
the Scottish border they found their path barred
by Hotspur, who had slipped round them, with a
slightly superior force. They would have been glad
enough to get home with their booty, but Percy
gave them no option; they had nothing for it but
to fight.</p>

<p>The result of the battle was disastrous to the
Scots. The English archers broke every effort they
made to get to close quarters, and finally routed
them with scarcely any assistance from the men-at-arms.
An immense number were slain; five hundred
were drowned in the Tweed; eighty noblemen
and knights, the flower of their chivalry, including
the Earl of Douglas himself, were captured. A
goodly haul for Percy in the shape of ransom! But
it was these very prisoners and this very question of
ransom that filled Hotspur&rsquo;s cup of bitterness against
the King and brought about his league with Glyndwr.
The congratulations which went speeding
northward from Henry to his &ldquo;dear cousin&rdquo; were
somewhat damped by instructions that the Scottish
prisoners were on no account to be set at liberty
or ransomed, but were in fact to be handed over
to himself&mdash;contrary to all custom and privilege.
Large sums were already owing to Percy for his outlay
in North Wales on the King&rsquo;s behalf, and he was
sullen, as we know, at the King&rsquo;s neglect of his
brother-in-law Mortimer, still lying unransomed in
Owen&rsquo;s hands. He was now enraged, and his rage
bore fruit a few months later on the bloody field of
Shrewsbury. Nor did Henry see the face of one of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>183]</a></span>
his prisoners till they appeared in arms against him,
as the price of their liberty, upon that fateful day.</p>

<p>The close of this year was marked by no events of
note; marriage bells were in the air, for the King
was espousing Joanna of Brittany, and Mortimer,
now embittered against Henry, allied himself with
Glyndwr&rsquo;s fortunes and married his fourth daughter,
Jane.</p>

<p>Mortimer&rsquo;s alliance was indeed of immense value
to Glyndwr. He was not only the guardian and
natural protector of the rightful heir to the throne,
his nephew, but he was a possibly acceptable candidate
himself, in the event of a fresh shuffling of the
cards. He had moreover large possessions and
castles in the South Wales Marches, and in the Vale
of Clwyd, whose occupants would now be irrevocably
committed to the Welsh cause.</p>

<p>The monk of Evesham tells us that the marriage
was celebrated with the greatest solemnity about
the end of November, though where the ceremony
took place we do not know. A fortnight afterwards
Mortimer wrote to his Radnor tenants this letter in
French, which has been fortunately preserved and
is now in the British Museum:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Very dear and well-beloved, I greet you much and
make known to you that Oweyn Glyndwr has raised a
quarrel of which the object is, if King Richard be alive,
to restore him to his crown; and if not that, my honoured
nephew, who is the right heir to the said crown,
shall be King of England, and that the said Oweyn will
assert his right in Wales. And I, seeing and considering
that the said quarrel is good and reasonable, have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>184]</a></span>
consented to join in it, and to aid and maintain it, and
by the grace of God to a good end, Amen. I ardently
hope, and from my heart, that you will support and
enable me to bring this struggle of mine to a successful
issue. I have moreover to inform you that the lordships
of Melenyth, Werthresson, Rayadr, the Commote
of Udor, Arwystly, Keveilloc, and Kereynon are lately
come into our possession. Wherefore I moreover entreat
you that you will forbear making inroad into my said
lands, or doing any damage to my said tenantry, and
that you furnish them with provisions at a certain
reasonable price, as you would wish that I should treat
you; and upon this very point be pleased to send me an
answer. Very dear and well-beloved, God give you
grace to prosper in your beginnings, and to arrive at a
happy time. Written at Melenyth the 13th day of
December.</p>

<p class="sig">&ldquo;Edmund Mortimer.</p>

<p>This note was no doubt chiefly aimed at Sir John
Greyndor, or Grindor, who guarded the King&rsquo;s
interests and commanded several castles at various
times. It was the last incident of moment in the
year 1402.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br />
<br />
<span class="vsmlfont">THE BATTLE OF SHREWSBURY<br />
1403</span></h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE opening of the year 1403 was a time full of
promise for Owen&rsquo;s cause. The western castles
by whose capture he set such store were
hard pressed. Llandovery in the Vale of Towy had
been reduced; Llandeilo Fawr, close by, burnt. The
noble castle of Dynevor, which had been the royal
seat of the Princes of South Wales, was in difficulties,
and a descent on the southern shores of England
by the French was once more looked for. The
Scots, too, had again plucked up their courage, and
threatened to give trouble. King Henry was begging
or demanding loans from all sorts and conditions
of men, that he might be enabled to hold his
own against the Welsh, the Scots, and the French.
His affairs in truth were anything but prosperous.
The Prince of Wales, however, was at his post at
Shrewsbury, though pressing for men and money.
He informs his father that Glyndwr is preparing to
invade England, and Henry communicates the disquieting
news to his council, though this is somewhat
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>186]</a></span>
later, since in May the Prince is writing urgent
letters for relief. In these he declares that his soldiers
will remain no longer with him unless they are
paid, and that Glyndwr is levying all the power of
North and South Wales to destroy the Marches and
the adjoining counties of England. The Prince goes
on to say: &ldquo;If our men are withdrawn from us we
must retire to England and be disgraced forever.
At present we have very great expenses, and we
have raised the largest sum in our power to meet
them from our little stock of jewels.&rdquo; This, it may
perhaps be again remarked, is the London rou&eacute; and
trifler of popular fancy!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Our two castles of Harlech and Lampadarn are besieged
and we must relieve and victual them within ten
days, and besides that protect the March around us with
one-third of our forces. And now since we have fully
shown the state of these districts, please to take such
measures as shall seem best to you for the safety of
these same parts. And be well assured we have fully
shown to you the peril of whatever may happen here if
remedy be not sent in time.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Reinforcements of some kind must have reached
the ardent young soldier very soon. For within a
week or two he exercised a most signal piece of vengeance
against Glyndwr and apparently without
opposition. This was no less than the complete destruction
of Sycherth and Glyndyfrdwy, while Owen
was busy upon the Merioneth coast. As all we
know of this interesting affair is from the Prince&rsquo;s
own pen, I cannot do better than quote in full the
letter by which he communicated the news to his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>187]</a></span>
father and his council. The original is preserved in
the British Museum, and is in the French language.
It is dated May 15th, no year unfortunately being
affixed. Some difference of opinion as to the latter
detail exists, but this year (1403), the latest of those
in dispute, seems to me the likeliest.</p>

</div>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Very dear and entirely well beloved, we greet you
much from our whole heart, thanking you, very dearly
for the attention you have paid to everything needful
that concerned us during our absence, and we pray of
you very earnestly the continuance of your good and
kind disposition; as our trust is in you. By way of
news that have here occurred, if you wish to hear of
them, we have among other matters been lately informed
that Owen de Glyndowrdy has assembled his forces, and
those of other rebels adhering to him in great number;
purposing to commit inroads, and in case of any resistance
being made to him by the English, to come to
battle with them, for so he vaunted to his people.
Wherefore we took our forces and marched to a place of
the said Oweyn well built, which was his principal mansion,
called Saghern [Sycherth], where we thought we
should have found him, if he had an inclination to fight
in the manner he had said, but on our arrival there, we
found nobody; and therefore caused the whole place
to be burnt, and several other houses near it belonging
to his tenants. We thence marched straight
to his other place of Glyndowerdy to seek for him there
and we caused a fine lodge in his park to be destroyed
by fire, and laid waste all the country around. We
there halted for the night and certain of our people sallied
forth into the country, and took a gentleman of the
neighbourhood who was one of the said Oweyn&rsquo;s chief
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>188]</a></span>
captains. This person offered five hundred pounds for
his ransom to preserve his life, and to be allowed two
weeks for the purpose of raising that sum of money; but
the offer was not accepted and he received death, as did
several of his companions, who were taken the same day.
We then proceeded to the Commote of Edeyrnion in
Merionethshire, and there laid waste a fine and populous
country; thence we went to Powys, and there being a
want of provender in Wales for horses, we made our
people carry oats with them and pursued our march;
and in order to give you full intelligence of this march
of ours and of everything that has occurred here, we
send to you our well beloved esquire, John de Waterton,
to whom you will be pleased to give entire faith, and
credence in what he shall report to you touching the
events above mentioned. And may our Lord have you
always in his holy keeping. Given under our Seal at
Shrewsbury the 15th day of May.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If, as I think, 1403 is the right year to which we
should assign this letter, it may seem strange that
Glyndwr should have left his estates to their fate.
On the other hand, Sycherth, or Saghern as the
Prince calls it, actually touched Offa&rsquo;s Dyke and the
English border, while Glyndyfrdwy, as I have before
noted, was within sight of Dinas Br&acirc;n, the grim outpost
of English power. Glyndwr&rsquo;s attention had
been largely devoted to South Wales and was now
bent on securing those great castles on the Merioneth
and Carnarvon coast, which with their sea connections
threatened him perpetually in his rear.
Above all, his aspirations had now soared to such a
height and the stake he was playing for was so great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>189]</a></span>
it is not likely that the loss of a couple of manor-houses
and a few other buildings was of much import
to him. If he won his cause, they were of no
moment at all. If, on the other hand, he lost it, all
was over; they would certainly be no longer his.
A want of local knowledge has led many historians
astray in the matter of these manors of Glyndwr&rsquo;s,
and they have repeated each other&rsquo;s mistakes, ignoring
the Cynllaeth property, and only transferring the
name of its much larger house to the banks of the
Dee. Even Pennant falls into the error, and is probably
responsible for that of many of his successors.</p>

<p>This is the more curious in view of Prince Henry&rsquo;s
letter, distinctly stating that he first destroyed
Owen&rsquo;s principal mansion at that point and naturally
so, as it would be the first in his path on the
direct route from Shrewsbury, following the valleys
of the Vyrnwy and the Tanat, and then up the
Cynllaeth brook, where Sycherth lies. Prince
Henry&rsquo;s failure to spell the name of Owen&rsquo;s residence
intelligibly is of no moment whatever, and is
almost lucid compared to some of the Norman attempts
to render Welsh names into English.</p>

<p>Sir Henry Ellis and others who, though realising
that Owen had two separate properties, are not
familiar with the district, fall back on Leland, who
alludes to Rhaggat, the present seat of the Lloyds,
as having been &ldquo;a place of Glyndwr&rsquo;s,&rdquo; and explain
Prince Henry&rsquo;s &ldquo;Saghern&rdquo; in that manner. Rhaggat,
beyond a doubt, whatever dwelling may then
have stood there, was the property of Glyndwr, seeing
that it was on his Glyndyfrdwy estate and less
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>190]</a></span>
than two miles up the Dee from his Glyndyfrdwy
house. But the Prince would have had to pass by
the latter to reach Rhaggat, reversing the stated order
of his operations, whereas his short campaign as
described by himself took the objects of his attack,
Sycherth, Glyndyfrdwy, and the Vale of Edeyrnion
in due order. These are matters, it is true, rather
of local than of general interest. Still as the locality
is one which great numbers of strangers visit for its
beauty, I may perhaps be pardoned for entering
somewhat minutely into these details.</p>

<p>While the Prince was thus doing his best upon a
small scale near the border, and sore distressed for
money to pay his men, the castles of Harlech, Criccieth,
Conway, Carnarvon, and Rhuddlan were hard
pressed. Being in the royal counties, they were
held and manned at the royal charge and were feeling
to the full the pinch of poverty. Owen, entirely
satisfied with the prospect of their speedy reduction,
moved south about the time that the Prince was
wasting his property on the Cynllaeth and the Dee.
We hear of him in piteous letters for aid, sent by
Jankyn Hanard, the Constable of Dynevor Castle, on
the Towy, to his brother&mdash;Constable of Brecon, who
was in but little better plight. In this correspondence
the writer declares that Glyndwr dominates the
whole neighbouring country with 8240 spears at his
back; that Rhys Gethin, the victor of Pilleth, is
with him, also Henry Don, Rhys Ddu, and Rhys ap
Griffith ap Llewelyn, the son of that gallant gentleman
of Cardiganshire who made such a cheerful sacrifice
of his head, it will be remembered, two years
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>191]</a></span>
before, when King Henry was at Strata Florida,
trying in vain to come to blows with Owen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is great peril for me,&rdquo; continues the panic-stricken
Constable, &ldquo;for they [Glyndwr&rsquo;s soldiers]
have made a vow that they will all have us ded
therein; wherefor I pray thee that thou wilt not
boggle us, but send to us warning within a short time
whether we schule have any help or no.&rdquo; The garrison,
he reports, are fainting, in victuals and men,
and they would all be glad enough to steal away to
Brecon, where the castle is in a better state for
holding out. &ldquo;Jenkin ap Llewelyn, William Gwyn,
Thomas ap David, and moni other gentils be in person
with Owen.&rdquo; He tells also of the capture of
Carmarthen just effected by Glyndwr,&mdash;both town
and castles,&mdash;with a loss of fifty men to the defenders.
A second letter, written early in July, a few days
only after the first one and from the same frightened
commandant, describes Glyndwr as still halting in
his mind as to whether or no he should burn Carmarthen.
It goes on to relate how Owen and most
of his army moved forward to the great castle of
Kidwelly, which stood upon the seacoast near the
mouth of the Towy, some ten miles distant.</p>

<p>But in the meantime the Anglo-Flemings from
Western Pembroke and Gower, of all districts in
Wales the most hostile to a Cymric revival, were
coming up again in strong force, under their lord
and governor, Thomas Earl Carew. Glyndwr halted
on July 9th at St. Clear&rsquo;s and opened negotiations
with Carew, influenced probably by the view that
Western Pembroke with its sturdy Teutonic stock,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>192]</a></span>
and line of impregnable castles, would prove more
difficult to conquer and to hold than the effort was
worth. While pourparlers were proceeding, he sent
forward seven hundred men, to discover if it were
possible to get to the rear of the Anglo-Flemish
force, but they were cut off to a man and killed.
This was the most serious loss the Welsh had yet
sustained. Carew, however, did not follow up his
advantage, and Glyndwr, who, we are told, had much
booty stored in what was left of Carmarthen, made
his headquarters there for several days.</p>

<p>It is impossible to follow Owen step by step
through the hurly-burly of ruin, fire, and slaughter
which he created during this summer in South Wales.
It would be wearisome work, even if we could track
his steps from castle to castle, and from town to
town with accuracy. But there is ample enough
evidence of his handiwork and of the terror he
spread, in the panic-stricken correspondence that
came out of the Marches from all sorts of people
during these months, and which anyone may read
to-day. We hear from time to time of his lieutenants,
of Rhys Gethin, the Tudors, and many others,
but no name in the minds of men ever seems to approach
that of the dread chief, who was the life and
organiser of every movement. Whether Owen is
present in person at a siege or a battle or not, it is
always with his enemies, &ldquo;Owen&rsquo;s men,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Owen&rsquo;s
intentions,&rdquo; &ldquo;Owen&rsquo;s magic, ambition, and wickedness&rdquo;;
and at the terror of his name nervous people
and monks were trembling far into the midland
counties. An invasion of England was thoroughly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>193]</a></span>
expected at various times during 1403, and such a
visit from a warrior who could call at will the lightning
and the tempest to his aid, and whose track was
marked by a desolation, so it was rumoured, more
pitiless than even medieval ethics approved of, was
a terrible eventuality. In the eastern counties men
were informed for certain that he was soon to be at
Northampton, while the monks of St. Albans hung
a supplication upon the chancel wall to the Almighty
God to spare them from Glyndwr.</p>

<p>John Faireford, Receiver of Brecon, writes urgently
to the authorities of the county of Hereford,
telling them how all the gentry of Carmarthen had
now risen treasonably against the King, and how his
friend, the Constable of Dynevor, was in vain appealing
to him for help; how Owain Glyndwr with his
false troops was at Llandover, the men of that castle
being assured to him, and the Welsh soldiers all
lying around the castle at their ease; and again how
Glyndwr was on his march to that very town of
Brecon for the destruction of the same, &ldquo;which God
avert.&rdquo; Faireford begs them to rally all the counties
round and to prepare them at once for resisting these
same rebels with all haste possible for the avoiding
of greater peril. &ldquo;And you will know,&rdquo; writes he,
&ldquo;that all the Welsh nation, being taken a little by
surprise, is adhering to this evil purpose of rebellion,
and if any expedition of cavalry can be made
be pleased to do that first in these Lordships of
Brecon and Cantref Sellys.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Within a few days a letter from the same hand is
forwarded to the King himself.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>194]</a></span>
&ldquo;My most noble and dread Lord, I have received at
Brecon certain letters addressed to me by John Skidmore,
the which enclosed within this letter, I present unto
your high person by the bearer of these, that it may
please your gracious lordship to consider the mischief
and perils comprised in them, and to ordain thereupon
speedy remedy for the destruction and resistance of the
rebels in those parts of South Wales, who are treacherously
raised against you and your Majesty, so that your
castles and towns and the faithful men in them be not
thus ruined and destroyed for lack of aid and succour.
And besides, may it please your lordship to know that
the rebels of this your lordship of Brecon, together with
their adherents, are lying near the town of Brecon doing
all the mischief they can to its town and neighbourhood,
and they purpose, all of them together, to burn all pertaining
to the English in these same parts if they be not
resisted in haste. The whole of the Welsh nation are by
all these said parties conformed in this rebellion, and
with good will consent together as only appears from
day to day. May it please your royal Majesty to ordain
a final destruction of all the false nation aforesaid, or
otherwise all your faithful ones in these parts are in
great peril.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The sheriff of Hereford had been warned by the
King to proceed against Brecon with the forces of
his county, and relieve the siege. This he reports
later, that he has done with some success; slaying
240 of the Welsh, though with what loss to himself
he refrains from mentioning. This diversion seems
in no way to have relieved the general situation; for
after describing the fight at Brecon he goes on to
state that</p>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>195]</a></span>
&ldquo;these same rebels purpose again to come in haste
with a great multitude to take the town (which God
avert) and to approach to the Marches and counties adjoining
to the destruction of them, which force we have
no power to resist without your most earnest aid and
succour, and this greatly displeases us by reason of the
grievous costs and labours which it will be needful for
us to sustain. In reference to which matters, our most
dread and sovereign Lord, may it please you to ordain
speedy remedy, which cannot be as we deem without
your gracious arrival in these parts for no other hope
remains.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This appeal is signed &ldquo;your humble lieges the
Sheriffs, Knights, Esquires, and Commons of your
County of Hereford.&rdquo; Hugh de Waterton follows
in the same alarmist strain:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;For the honour of God and the preservation of your
estate and honour may it please your Highness to have
this in your remembrance and soon to cause to commit
to such an array of sufficient persons, knights, and
esquires, as shall be willing to give their whole diligence
and trouble for the protection of your honour in the
preservation of your faithful lieges and the punishment
of your rebels, or otherwise the only thing that can be
said, is, it is likely you will find all in confusion which
God avert.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then follows William de Beauchamp writing to the
same purpose in a long, rambling letter to the King.
Lastly Richard Kingeston, Archdeacon of Hereford
and Dean of Windsor and general administrator for
the King on the Southern Marches, within the same
period of panic, appeals direct to his Majesty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>196]</a></span>
In one of these missives he says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;From day to day letters are arriving from Wales by
which you may learn that the whole country is lost unless
you go there as quick as possible. Be pleased to set
forth with all your power and march by night as well
as by day, for the salvation of those parts. It will be a
great disgrace as well as damage to lose in the beginning
of your reign a country which your ancestors gained
and retained so long; for people speak very unfavourably; ...&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is signed &ldquo;Your lowly creature, Richard Kingeston,&rdquo;
with a postscript added, &ldquo;And for God&rsquo;s love,
my liege Lord, think on yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The second letter, written somewhat later, contains
the following:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;There are come into our country more than four hundred
of the rebels of Owen and they have captured and
robbed within your county of Hereford many men and
beasts in great number as Miles Walter the bearer of
these presents will more fully tell you by mouth than I
can write to you at present, to whom may it please you
to give your faith and credence in that on which he shall
inform you for the preservation of your said county and
of all the country around.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The said Miles Walter, moreover, is</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;the most valiant man at arms in Herefordshire or the
Marches as he has served his Majesty well and lost
all that he hath. He begs for a hundred lances and
six hundred archers at once until your most gracious
arrival for the salvation of us all; for, my most dread
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>197]</a></span>
Lord, you will find for certain that if you do not come
in your own person to await your rebels in Wales you will
not find a single gentleman that will stop in your said
county [Hereford], and leave naught that you do not
come, for no man that may counsel you to the contrary.
This day the Welshmen suppose that and trust that you
will not come there and therefore for God&rsquo;s love make
them false men.... For salvation of your shire
and Marches trust you naught to any lieutenant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Written at Hereford in very great haste.</p>

<p class="sig2">&ldquo;Your humble creature and<br />
continual orator.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have somewhat tried the reader&rsquo;s patience, perhaps,
with such a multiplication of extracts all sounding
the same note; but in dealing with scenes so
scanty of all record save the bare detail of siege and
slaughter, it seems to me that human voices, full of
the fears and alarms of the moment, coming to us out
of this almost forgotten period, have more than ordinary
value. Glyndwr, too, at this moment steps out
of his armour and gives us one of those brief glimpses
of the man within, which one so eagerly grasps at.
To what extent he was himself imbued with the
superstition that surged around him and so conspicuously
centred upon his own name, must always
be a matter of curiosity. That he was very far from
a sceptic, however, he gives us conclusive proof; for
while lying at Carmarthen after settling matters with
Carew, he was seized with a desire to consult a
soothsayer; and acting upon this he sent for a certain
Welshman out of Gower, whose reputation for
forecasting future events, and &ldquo;skill in interpreting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>198]</a></span>
the Brut,&rdquo; was great. Hopkyn ap Thomas was the
name of this prophet of Gower, and when Owen demanded
what the future had in store for himself and
his cause, the local wise man showed himself at any
rate no sycophant, though a false prophet, as it so
turned out. For he boldly informed the Welsh
leader that within a short time he would be taken
prisoner under a black banner between Carmarthen
and Gower.</p>

<p>But all this earlier period of the summer, while
Glyndwr was marching this way and that throughout
South Wales, now repelling the Flemings on the
west, now ravaging the English border on the east,
matters in England closely connected with his own
fortunes were quickly ripening for one of the most
critical events of this period of English history. The
Prince of Wales, after his brief raid on Sycherth and
Glyndyfrdwy, had remained inactive at Shrewsbury,
unable from lack of means to move the levies of the
four border counties, who remained in whole or part,
and somewhat discontented, beneath his banner. The
Pell Rolls show a note for July 17th, of the sum of
&pound;8108 for the wages of four barons, 20 knights, 476
esquires, and 2500 archers. The King, who had been
by no means deaf to the frantic appeals which had
come pouring in upon him from Wales, had fully intended
to act upon them in person. He was always
as ready, however, to answer a summons from the
North as he was reluctant to face the truth in the
West. Wales had been virtually wrested from him
by Glyndwr, and he had ample warning that the
latter was even preparing for an invasion of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>199]</a></span>
England, where there existed a growing faction, wearied
by his ceaseless demands for money, which produced
so little glory and so much disgrace.</p>

<p>But once again he turned from scenes that for a
long time had been a standing reproach, both to
himself and England, and started for the North.
Even if he had been only bent on assisting the
Percys in stemming a threatened invasion of the
Scots, one might well suppose that the virtual loss of
what was a considerable portion of his dominions
near home, together with an equally imminent invasion
from that quarter, would demand his first attention.
But there is not even this much to be said.
The King cherished aspirations to be another Edward
the First; he had already achieved a precarious
footing in Scotland and made grants of conquered
territory across the border to English subjects, always
providing, of course, they could maintain themselves
there. One has the strange picture of an
otherwise sensible and long-headed monarch accepting
perennial defeat and defiance in Wales, while
straining after the annexation of distant territories
that were as warlike as they were poor. The Percys
had in fact for the past few months been playing at
war with the Scots, and deceiving Henry, while
laying plans for a deep game in quite another part
of Britain. The King, stern and at times even cruel
towards the world in general, was astonishingly complacent
and trustful towards that arch-plotter, the
Earl of Northumberland, who in defiance of his
master, though in strict accord with equity, had kept
his hold upon the Scottish prisoners of Homildon;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>200]</a></span>
answering the King&rsquo;s letters of remonstrance in light
and even bantering vein. But now all trace of ill-feeling
would seem to have vanished, as Henry and
his forces, on July 10th, rest for a day or two at
Higham Ferrers, on their way to the assistance of
the Percys; not to stem an invasion of the Scots,
but to further the King&rsquo;s preposterous and ill-timed
designs upon their territory. But this mad project
was nipped in the bud at the Northamptonshire town
in a manner that may well have taken Henry&rsquo;s
breath away and brought him to his senses.</p>

<p>He has just informed his council that he has received
news from Wales telling him of the gallant
bearing of his beloved son, and orders &pound;1000 to be
paid to his war chest. He then proceeds to tell
them that he is on his way to succour his dear and
loyal cousins, the Earl of Northumberland and his son
Henry, in the conflict which they have honourably
undertaken for him, and as soon as that campaign
shall have ended, with the aid of God he will hasten
to Wales. The next day he heard that his &ldquo;beloved
and loyal cousins&rdquo; were in open revolt against him,
and, instead of fighting the Scots, were hastening
southwards with all their Homildon prisoners as
allies and an ever gathering force to join Glyndwr.</p>

<p>What was the exact nature of this alliance, whose
proclamation fell upon the King like a thunderclap,
can only be a matter of conjecture. There are whispers,
as we know, of messages and messengers passing
between Glyndwr and Mortimer on the one
hand and the Percys on the other, this long time.
That they intended to act in unison there is, of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>201]</a></span>
course, no doubt. Shakespeare has anticipated by
some years and used with notable effect the famous
&ldquo;Tripartite Alliance,&rdquo; which was signed by Glyndwr,
Mortimer, and the Earl of Northumberland at the
Dean of Bangor&rsquo;s house at Aberdaron on a later occasion.
One regrets that in this particular he is not
accurate, for the dramatic effect, which as a poet he
had no reason to resist, is much more telling before
the field of Shrewsbury than it can be at any subsequent
time.</p>

<p>The well-known scene, where Glyndwr, Mortimer,
and Hotspur stand before an outspread map of England,
and divide its territory between them, is
probably to thousands of Englishmen their only distinct
vision of the Welsh chieftain as an historical
character. But though this formal indenture, as we
shall see, was entered into much later, there is no
doubt that some very similar intention existed even
now in the minds of the allies. Glyndwr&rsquo;s reward
was obvious. As to the throne of England, Richard&rsquo;s
ghost was to be resuscitated for the purpose of creating
enthusiasm in certain credulous quarters and
among the mob; but the young Earl of March was
the real and natural candidate for the throne. Edmund
Mortimer, however, stood very near to his
young nephew. He was Hotspur&rsquo;s brother-in-law,
and who could tell what might happen? He had
the sympathy of the Welsh, not only because his
property lay in their country, but because he could
boast the blood of Llewelyn ap Iorwerth, to say
nothing of his intimate connection with the Welsh
hero himself. The Earl of Northumberland may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>202]</a></span>
have had some understanding with regard to
northern territory, such as he bargained for in later
years, but of this we know nothing. It was an ill-managed
affair in any case, and it is probable that
the conditions in case of victory were loosely defined.</p>

<p>The King had reached Lichfield when the astounding
news burst upon him that he was betrayed,
and that he had not only to fight Glyndwr and the
Scotch, but to wrestle with the most powerful of his
subjects for his crown. Glyndwr was, of course, in
the secret, but plans had miscarried, or messengers
had gone astray. Without wearying the reader with
proofs and dates, it will be sufficient to recall the fact
that on July 12th Owen was negotiating with Carew,
and for the next few days his hands and head were
busily at work before the castle of Dynevor. He
had at that time no thought of leaving South Wales,
and this was within four or five days of the great
fight at Shrewsbury, nearly a hundred miles off, which
poets and romancists have painted him, of all people,
as cynically regarding from the safe vantage-point of
a distant oak tree!</p>

<p>Henry, prompt in an emergency and every inch a
soldier when outside Wales, lost not a moment. He
had with him but a moderate force, mostly his loyal
Londoners. The Prince of Wales was near Shrewsbury
with his recent reinforcements, and quickly
summoned. Urgent orders were sent out to the
sheriffs of the home counties, and on Friday, July
20th, in the incredibly short space of five days, the
King and Prince entered Shrewsbury with an army
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>203]</a></span>
of nearer thirty than twenty thousand men. They
were just in time, for that same evening Hotspur
(for his father had been detained in Northumberland
by illness) with a force usually estimated at about
15,000, arrived at the city gates, only to find to his
surprise the royal standard floating from the castle
tower, and the King already in possession. It was
then late in the afternoon and Hotspur led his army
to Berwick, a hamlet three miles to the north-west of
Shrewsbury. Though his father was not present, his
uncle, Thomas Percy, Earl of Worcester, had lately
joined him, having stolen away from the side of
Prince Henry, whose chief adviser he had lately
been. The Scottish Earl Douglas, who had been
his prisoner at Homildon, was now his ally, having,
together with his comrades in misfortune, purchased
liberty in this doubtless congenial fashion. Percy
had left Northumberland with 160 followers. His
force had now grown, as I have already remarked, to
something like 15,000 men.</p>

<p>The County Palatine of Chester, always turbulent
and still faithful to Richard&rsquo;s memory, was most
strongly represented in his ranks, and its archers
were among the best in England.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Numbers, too,
of Glyndwr&rsquo;s supporters from Flint and the Powys
lordships joined his standard, and Richard&rsquo;s badge
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>204]</a></span>
of the White Hart was prominent on their shields
and tunics. But Hotspur had assuredly reckoned on
meeting Glyndwr, and now where was he? He had
certainly never counted on being stopped by the
King with a superior force upon the borders of
Wales. He had now no choice but to fight, and
even Hotspur&rsquo;s fiery spirit must have drooped for a
moment when he counted the odds.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_10_10" id="Footnote_10_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10_10"><span class="label">[10]</span></a>
It had been made a military Palatinate by William the Conqueror,
with the special object of coercing North Wales. Having
lapsed to the Crown in Richard&rsquo;s time, that King had leaned greatly
in his difficulties on its warlike and independent population. The
latter with its military efficiency had developed a corresponding
arrogance and local pride, and Richard had been the last object of
its provincial devotion. <a href="#FNanchor_10_10">Back</a></p>
</div>

<p>The morning of the 21st broke and there was still
no Glyndwr and no alternative but battle; so, marching
his troops to Heytely or Bull field, a short three
miles to the north of Shrewsbury on the Wem road,
he drew them up in order of battle, near the place
where the church that was raised above their graves
now stands.</p>

<p>Hotspur for the moment was depressed. He had
just discovered that the hamlet where he had spent
the night was called Berwick, and a soothsayer in the
North had foretold that he should &ldquo;fall at Berwick,&rdquo;
meaning, of course, the famous town upon the Tweed.
The coincidence affected Percy and showed that if
Glyndwr was superstitious so also was he; for, turning
pale, he said: &ldquo;I perceive my plough is now
drawing to its last furrow.&rdquo; But the most lion-hearted
soldier in England soon shook off such
craven fears and proceeded to address his men in a
speech which Holinshed has preserved for us: a spirited
and manly appeal which we must not linger
over here. The King was curiously slow in moving
out against his foes, and even when, after noontide,
he had drawn up his formidable army in their front,
he gave his faithless friends yet one more chance,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>205]</a></span>
sending the Abbot of Shrewsbury to offer them good
terms even at this eleventh hour, and it was certainly
not fear that prompted the overture. Hotspur was
touched and inclined to listen, but his hot-headed or
mistrustful uncle of Worcester overruled him, even
going himself to the King&rsquo;s army and using language
that made conciliation impossible. It must
have been well into the afternoon when the King
threw his mace into the air as a signal for the bloodiest
battle to open that since the Norman conquest
had dyed the soil of England.</p>

<p>With such a wealth of description from various
authors, more or less contemporary, it is not easy to
pick out in brief the most salient features of this
sanguinary fight. It will be sufficient to say that
the shooting of Percy&rsquo;s Cheshire archers was so terrific
at the opening of the battle that the royal army
was thrown into confusion and only saved from rout
by the valour and presence of mind of the King,
who rallied his shaken troops and bore upon the
smaller forces of his enemy with irresistible pressure;
that the desperate charges of Hotspur and Lord
Douglas, cleaving lanes through their enemy as they
sought the King&rsquo;s person, were the leading personal
features of a fight where all were brave. The valour
of the young Prince Henry, too, seeing how prominent
a figure he is in our story, must be recorded,
and how, though badly wounded by an arrow in the
face, he resisted every effort to drag him from the
field and still sought the spot where the fight was
fiercest and the dead thickest. The courage and
coolness of the King, too, whose crown and kingdom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>206]</a></span>
were at stake, shone brightly in the deadly m&ecirc;l&eacute;e,
where his standard was overthrown, its bearer slain,
and the Constable of England, Lord Stafford, killed
at his feet. Hotspur, who had fought like a lion
with a score of knightly opponents, fell at length,
pierced by a missile from some unknown hand; and
before sunset his army was in full flight. The
slaughter was tremendous, and lasted far into the
dark hours; for it is curiously significant that as an
early moon rose over that bloody field, its face was
quickly hidden by an eclipse that may well have excited
the already strained imaginations of so superstitious
an age. About four thousand men lay dead
upon the field, among them two hundred knights
and gentlemen of Cheshire alone, who had followed
Percy. The Earl of Worcester and Lord Douglas
were both captured, the former receiving a traitor&rsquo;s
death. The corpse of the gallant Hotspur, after
being buried by a kinsman, was dug up again and
placed standing upright between two millstones in
Shrewsbury market-place, that all men might know
that the fierce Northumberland whelp, the friend of
Glyndwr, was dead. His quarters were then sent,
after the manner of the time, to decorate the walls
of the chief English cities, the honour of exhibiting
his head over the gates being reserved for York.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Under
Henry&rsquo;s
patronage.</div>

<p>The more illustrious dead were buried in the
graveyards of Shrewsbury. The rest were, for the
most part, huddled into great pits adjoining
the spot where the old church, that
was raised under Henry&rsquo;s patronage as a
shrine wherein masses might be said for their souls,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>207]</a></span>
still lifts its grey tower amid the quiet Shropshire
fields.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_11_11" id="Footnote_11_11"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11_11"><span class="label">[11]</span></a>
Battle-field Church, which now serves a small parish, is probably
the only instance in England of a church erected over the burial-pits
of a battle for the purpose of saying masses for the victims of a great
slaughter, and that now does duty as a parish church. The fabric
has had periods of dilapidation and been much restored, but a good
part of the walls is original. There was a college originally attached
to it, but all trace of this has disappeared. My first visit to
the battle-field was in company with the Rev. Dymock Fletcher,
well known as a Shropshire antiquary, who has published an interesting
pamphlet on this subject. <a href="#FNanchor_11_11">Back</a></p>
</div>

<p>And all this time Glyndwr, in far Carmarthen, was
in total ignorance of what a chance he had missed,
and what a calamity had occurred. If Hotspur had
been better served in his communications, or fate in
this respect had been kinder, and Glyndwr with
10,000 men had stood by the Percys&rsquo; side, how differently
might the course of English history have
run! It is fortunate for England, beyond a doubt,
that Hotspur fell at Shrewsbury and that Glyndwr
was not there, but from the point of view of his after
reputation, one cannot resist the feeling that a great
triumph upon the open plains of Shropshire, in an
historic fight, would have set that seal upon Glyndwr&rsquo;s
renown which some perhaps may think is wanting.
Reckless deeds of daring and aggression are more
picturesque attributes for a popular hero. But
Glyndwr&rsquo;s fame lies chiefly in the patience of his
strategy, his self-command, his influence over his
people, his tireless energy, his strength of will, and
dogged persistence. He had to do a vast deal with
small means: to unite a country honeycombed with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>208]</a></span>
alien interests, to fight enemies at home and beyond
the mountain borders of his small fatherland, and to
struggle with a nation that within man&rsquo;s memory
had laid France prostrate at its feet. Private adventures
and risky experiments he could not afford.
A great deal of statecraft fell to his share. His
efforts for Welsh independence could not ultimately
succeed without allies, and while he was stimulating
the irregular military resources of the Principality,
and making things safe there with no gentle hand,
his mind was of necessity much occupied with the
men and events that might aid him in the three
kingdoms and across the seas. His individual prowess
would depend almost wholly on tradition and the
odes of his laureate, Iolo Goch, if it were not for his
feat against the Flemings when surrounded by them
on the Plinlimmon Mountains:</p>

<div class="cpoem22">

<span class="i0">Flashed the red meteors from thy lance,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The harbinger of death.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But Glyndwr&rsquo;s renown, with all its blemishes, rests
on something more than sword-cuts and lance-thrusts.
He had been three years in the field, and
for two of them paramount in Wales. Now, however,
with the rout and slaughter of Shrewsbury, and
the immense increase of strength it gave to Henry, a
crushing blow had surely been struck at the Welsh
chieftain and his cause. Numbers of Owen&rsquo;s people
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>209]</a></span>
in Flint and the adjoining lordships, cowed by the
slaughter of half the gentry of sympathetic Cheshire,
and their own losses, came in for the pardon that
was freely offered. The King had a large army, too,
on the Welsh border, and the moment would seem
a singularly propitious one for bringing all Wales to
his feet, while the effect of his tremendous victory
was yet simmering in men&rsquo;s minds. But Henry was
too furious with the Percys for cool deliberation.
The old Earl had not been absent from the field of
Shrewsbury from disinclination, but from illness;
and he was now in the North stirring up revolt upon
all sides. But the ever active King, speeding northward,
checkmated him at York in such a way that
there was no option for the recusant nobleman but
to throw himself at his injured prince&rsquo;s feet and crave
forgiveness. It is to Henry&rsquo;s credit that he pardoned
his ancient friend. Perhaps he thought the
blood of two Percys was sufficient for one occasion;
so the old Earl rode out of York by the King&rsquo;s side,
under the festering head of his gallant son, on whom
he had been mean enough to throw the onus of his
own faithlessness, and was placed for a time out of
mischief at Coventry.</p>

<p>By the time, however, that Henry came south again
the battle of Shrewsbury, so far as Wales was concerned,
might never have been fought. Glyndwr&rsquo;s
confidence in the South was so great that he had
himself gone north to steady the men of Flint and
the borders in their temporary panic. His mission
seems to have been so effective that by the time the
King was back it was the town of Chester and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>210]</a></span>
neighbouring castles that were the victims of a panic.
An edict issued by Prince Henry, who lay recovering
from his wound at Shrewsbury, ordered the expulsion
of every Welshman from the border towns, the
penalty for return being death. Strenuous efforts
were again made to stop all trade between England
and Wales, but it was useless; a continuous traffic
in arms and provisions went steadily on, the goods
being exchanged for cattle and booty of all kinds in
which Owen&rsquo;s mountain strongholds now abounded.
On the Welsh side of Chester, hedges and ditches
were hastily formed as a protection against invasion,
and watchers were kept stationed night and day
along the shores of the Dee estuary.</p>

<p>It was the 8th of September when Henry arrived
from the north and prepared at Worcester for his
long-deferred expedition against Glyndwr. He first
issued formal orders to the Marcher barons to keep
their castles in readiness against assault and in
good repair!&mdash;a superfluous warning one would have
thought, and not devoid of irony, when addressed
to men who for a year or two had just managed to
maintain a precarious existence against the waters
of rebellion that surged all round them. Henry
was at his very wits&rsquo; end for money, and all those in
his interest were feeling the pinch of poverty. It so
happened that at this juncture the Archbishop of
Canterbury was attending the Court at Worcester,
and the sight of his magnificent retinue aroused
dangerous thoughts in the minds of the barons
around the King, who had spent so much blood and
treasure in his service and were now sorely pinched
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>211]</a></span>
for want of means. The same ideas occurred to
Henry, if indeed they were not suggested to him,
and in no uncertain voice he called upon the Church
for pecuniary aid against Glyndwr. The Archbishop
took in the situation and sniffed spoliation in the air.
At the bare idea of such intentions he grew desperate,
and with amazing courage bearded the King
himself, swearing that the first man who laid a finger
on church property should find his life no longer
worth living and his soul for ever damned. The
King was forced to soothe the excited cleric, who in
later and calmer moments came to the conclusion
that it would be perhaps prudent for the Church to
offer some pecuniary assistance to the Crown. This
was ultimately done, and the sum contributed was
about enough to pay the expenses of one of the
forty or fifty castles that were gradually falling into
Owen&rsquo;s hands.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Glyndwr had invaded Herefordshire,
penetrating as far as Leominster, and had
compelled that county to make special terms with
him and pay heavily for them too. The King, however,
had now everything in train for a general advance
through South Wales. What he did there
and what he left undone must be reserved for
another chapter.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br />
<br />
<span class="vsmlfont">OWEN AND THE FRENCH<br />
1403-1404</span></h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">K</span>ING Henry&rsquo;s fourth expedition against
Glyndwr, in spite of all the talk, the preparations,
the hard-wrung money grants, the
prayers and supplications for aid, will make but
scant demands upon our space. He spent some
days at Hereford, issuing orders for stores to be forwarded
to the hard-pressed castles of South Wales
from the port of Bristol, though it is obvious that
only some of them could be relieved by sea. The
names of a few of these may interest Welshmen.
They were Llandovery, Crickhoell, Tretower, Abergavenny,
Caerleon, Goodrich, Ewyas Harold, Usk,
Caerphilly, Ewyas Lacy, Paines, Brampton Bryan,
Lyonshall, Dorston, Manorbier, Stapleton, Kidwelly,
Lampeter, Brecon, Cardiff, Newport, Milford, Haverford-west,
Pembroke, and Tenby.</p>

<p>The King left Hereford about the 15th of September
and he was seated a few days later among
the ruins of Carmarthen, the very centre of the
recent wars and devastations. Glyndwr and his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>213]</a></span>
people were, of course, nowhere to be seen, nor did
the King show any disposition to hunt for them.
He remained about two days at Carmarthen, and
contented himself with issuing all kinds of orders,
proclamations, pardons, and confiscations, which
were for the most so much waste paper. Leaving
behind him the Earl of Somerset with an inefficient
garrison and no money to pay them, he then faced
about, and made the best of his way back again,
arriving at Hereford within four days. When one
recalls Edward the First, who considered nearly three
years of personal residence none too short a time in
which to establish order in Wales, which was at that
time by no means so wholly hostile as now, the feebleness
of Henry&rsquo;s Welsh policy strikes one with
singular force. Had he been his cousin Richard or
an Edward the Second, a man sluggish in war and a
slave to luxury, the explanation would be simple
enough; but though his Court was extravagant,
almost culpably so, the King himself was an energetic,
serious-minded soldier, and a man of affairs
rather than of pleasure. One might well have
supposed, after the decisive victory at Shrewsbury,
and the firm grip on the throne which the destruction
of his domestic enemies gave to the King, that
Glyndwr&rsquo;s hour had at last come.</p>

<p>It is almost wearisome to tell the same old tale of
&ldquo;scuttle,&rdquo; the same trumpeting forth of orders to
captains and governors of castles and Marcher
barons to do, with scant men and means, what their
master had so conspicuously flinched from with the
power of England, such as he had made it, at his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>214]</a></span>
command. It is needless to say that the King&rsquo;s
homeward tracks through Wales were obliterated,
when his back was turned, like those upon sand, before
the returning tide of Owen and his Welshmen,
who had swept through Glamorgan and were pressing
Cardiff, even while Henry was still travelling
homewards. He had hardly reached London before
he received piteous letters from the chiefs of the garrison
that had been left at Carmarthen, begging him
to send the Duke of York there with strong reinforcements
or they were lost men, and protesting
that in no case could they stay there a day longer
than the stipulated month, for their men would not
stand by them.</p>

<p>Glyndwr had received some sort of consolation
from the French for the blow struck at his English
allies on the plains of Shrewsbury. Their corsairs
had been harrying the shores of England throughout
the summer. Plymouth, Salcombe, and other places
had been raided, while flotillas were even now hovering
round the coast of Wales, in the interests of
Owen. Herefordshire, which had received the long-looked-for
King with such unbounded joy in September,
and hailed him as its deliverer, was, in
October, in as bad a plight as ever, for Glyndwr&rsquo;s
men had again poured over the borders. And
though the King with his thousands had come and
gone like a dream, the people of Hereford and
Gloucester were now glad enough to welcome the
Duke of York with nine hundred spearmen and
archers. The Courtenays with a force of Devonshire
men had been ordered across the Severn sea
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>215]</a></span>
to relieve Cardiff, but this they failed in doing, as
now not only that fortress, but Caerphilly, Newport,
Caerleon, and Usk fell into Owen&rsquo;s hands.</p>

<p>The number of men that Glyndwr had with him
at various times is difficult to estimate. Now and
then contemporary writers quote the figures. In
South Wales lately it will be remembered he had
nearly ten thousand. In Carmarthen at another
time the number from an equally credible source
is estimated at thirty thousand. His spearmen were
better than his archers. The Welsh archers, till the
Union and the wars with France, had used short
bows made generally of twisted twigs and formidable
only at a close range. Archery, however, in its
highly developed state must have become familiar by
this time, through the co-operation of the Welsh in
the French wars. The Welsh spears were exceptionally
long, and the men of Merioneth had a special
reputation for making efficient use of them. They
were all, however, eminently light troops, though
equipped with steel caps, breastplates, and often with
greaves. &ldquo;In the first attack,&rdquo; says Giraldus Cambrensis,
&ldquo;the Welsh are more than men, in the
second less than women,&rdquo; and he knew them well.
But their want of staunchness under repulse, he
takes care to tell us, was temporary. They were a
people well-nigh impossible to conquer, he declares,
from the rapidity with which they recovered from
defeat and the tenacity with which they returned,
not always immediately, but sooner or later, to the
attack, refusing to acknowledge ultimate defeat,
and desperately attached to liberty. Glyndwr had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>216]</a></span>
practically no cavalry. Horses were very widely in
use, perhaps ponies still more so, amid the medi&aelig;val
Welsh, and their gentry and nobility went mounted
to war from the earliest times. But it is likely that
in Wales itself, at any rate, all ranks did their actual
fighting on foot.</p>

<p>Of the disposition of Glyndwr&rsquo;s forces and their
personnel beyond a few of his captains we know little.
It seems almost certain that the men of the South
for the most part fought in the south, and those of
the North in the north. If he had a nucleus of soldiers
that followed him in his rapid movements from
one end of the Principality to the other it was a
comparatively small one. In every district he had
trusted leaders who looked after his interests, and on
his appearance, or at his summons, rallied their followers
to battle, and upon their own account made
the lives of the beleaguered Saxons in their midst
intolerable. By this time, however, and indeed before
it, every man who was not a professed subject
of the descendant of Llewelyn and of Madoc ap
Griffith, had fled Wales, except those who were
swelling the population of the ill-victualled and
closely beleaguered castles. Glyndwr had before
him many a doughty Anglo-Norman warrior, under
walls well-nigh impervious to anything but starvation,
whose crumbling shells on many a Welsh headland
and hilltop still wake memories of the past and
stir our fancy.</p>

<p>Lord Audley was at Llandovery, Sir Henry Scrope
at Langhame, John Pauncefote held Crickhowl, and
James Berkeley, Tretower. At Abergavenny was a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>217]</a></span>
Beauchamp, at Goodrich a Neville. The splendid
pile of Caerphilly, whose ruins are the largest in
Britain, was in the charge of a Ch&acirc;telaine, Lady Despencer.
The noble castle of Manorbier, where Giraldus
was born, in that of Sir John Cornwall, while
the Earl of Warwick was at Paines, and a Charlton,
of course, at Welshpool.</p>

<p>About the same time, some French companies
were landing in Carmarthen to add further to the
woes of Henry in Wales; and for the comfort of
Glyndwr. The King himself was entering London,
and to show how little the people of one end of the
country sometimes realised what was actually happening
at the other, the citizens, who were always
his particular friends, gave him quite an enthusiastic
reception. It should, however, be remembered
that the Londoners had been in great force at
Shrewsbury, and the triumphs of that bloody fight
were still ringing in men&rsquo;s ears.</p>

<p>It was not till two years after this that the great
French effort was made on Owen&rsquo;s behalf, of which we
shall hear in due course, but even now a few hundred
Bretons, as already related, had found their way to
Wales. They flinched from the great Pembroke
castles and, adventuring upon their own account,
crept round the coast of Lleyn and made an attempt
upon Carnarvon. A very short stay before that
matchless pile of Norman defensive art sufficed
upon this occasion for the invaders, though soon
afterwards they landed and joined Glyndwr in its
investment. The island of Anglesey in the meantime,
cut off from the rest of Wales by the castles
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>218]</a></span>
and &ldquo;English towns&rdquo; of Conway and Carnarvon, and
its own almost equally formidable stronghold of
Beaumaris, had for the moment given in to English
reinforcements from Chester, and accepted the freely
offered pardon of the Prince of Wales. It is a singular
fact that, while so many of Glyndwr&rsquo;s soldiers,
headed by the Tudors, came from Anglesey and near
the close of his wars 2000 of its inhabitants were
actually in arms, no battle or even skirmish took
place there, so far as we know, during the whole
period of these operations.</p>

<p>But Carnarvon, now at this date, January, 1404,
was as a matter of fact in a lamentable condition as
regards defenders. The garrison had declined to less
than thirty men, and there are letters in Sir Henry
Ellis&rsquo;s collection showing the desperate state to which
this and other castles were reduced. It seems at the
first sight incredible that such a handful of men could
hold so great a fortress against serious attacks. The
walls and defences of Carnarvon Castle are to-day
much what they were in the times of Glyndwr. It
is perhaps almost necessary to walk upon its giddy
parapets, to climb its lofty towers, in order to grasp
the hopelessly defiant front such a fortress must
have shown to those below it before the time of effective
artillery: the deep moat upon the town side,
the waters of the harbour a hundred feet below the
frowning battlements upon the other, the huge gateway
from which the portcullis grinned and the upraised
drawbridge swung. Twenty-eight men only
were inside when Owen with a force of his own
people and the French threw themselves against it.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>219]</a></span>
The besiegers had engines, &ldquo;scowes,&rdquo; and scaling
ladders, but the handful of defenders were sufficient,
for the time being at any rate, to hurry from point
to point, and frustrate all attempts to surmount the
lofty walls, though these attempts, no doubt, were
made at many points simultaneously. The Constable
John Bolde was away, but one Parry, his
deputy, was in command. It was urgent that a message
should be sent to Chester, acquainting Venables,
the governor, of their desperate situation. Not a
man, as may well be believed, could be spared, so a
woman was despatched to take the news by word of
mouth, for few dared in those days to carry letters.</p>

<p class="caption">CARNARVON CASTLE.</p>
</div>

<p>Harlech was in an equally bad plight, its defenders
being reduced to twenty-six, but it was as impregnable
as Carnarvon, and much smaller. The garrison
had been so mistrustful of their governor&rsquo;s fidelity
that they had locked him up. During January
their numbers were reduced to sixteen, but they
still held manfully out against the Welsh under
Howel Vychan. They eventually succeeded in sending
word across the bay to Criccieth, and to Conway
also, of their condition. Conway had been
urgently petitioning the King and assuring him that
400 more men would suffice to hold the castles till
the spring, but that then &ldquo;when the rebels can lie out
which they cannot now do&rdquo; a far greater number
would be required; but the King either could not or
would not understand. Harlech, grim and grey on
its incomparable rocky perch, required fewer defenders
even than the rest. The sea then swept over
the half-mile strip of land, the &ldquo;Morfa Harlech,&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>220]</a></span>
that now lies dry beneath it, and lapped the
base of the lofty rock on whose summit the great
Edward&rsquo;s remotest castle still stands defiant of the
ages.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_12_12" id="Footnote_12_12"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12_12"><span class="label">[12]</span></a>
That ships could reach the gate at the foot of the rock of Harlech
is undoubted. What course the water took or how much of the
Morfa was actually under water is a matter of uncertainty.

<p>Henry had issued orders that these sea-girt castles
should be looked to by his navy. But Henry&rsquo;s admirals
seem to have had as little liking for Welsh
seas as the King himself had for Welsh mountains,
though happily some Bristol sailors appear to have
done their best to supply the deficiency. Glyndwr,
however, was determined to have Harlech without
loss of further time. Coming there from Carnarvon
he parleyed with the garrison, and offered terms
which all but seven accepted. What became of this
uncompromising minority it would be hard to say,
but at any rate Owen entered into possession and
there is good reason to suppose that he planted his
family here and made his headquarters upon the
historic rock where Br&acirc;n the Blessed and a long line
of less shadowy Welsh chieftains had dwelt, ages
before the rearing of these Norman towers.</p>

</div>

<p>Later on we hear of his summoning a parliament to
Harlech, but during this year the first of these legislative
assemblies that he called together met at
Machynlleth, as being unquestionably a more convenient
rendezvous for Welshmen in general. Hither
came &ldquo;four persons of sufficient consequence&rdquo; out of
each &ldquo;Cantref&rdquo; (the old unit of division in Wales), to
take counsel for future action and to gather around
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>221]</a></span>
the throne, upon which they had now seated a
crowned Prince of their own race. One of the
Welsh gentlemen, however, who attended this historic
parliament, came with very different intentions,
and this was David ap Llewelyn ap Howel, otherwise
known as Davy Gam, or &ldquo;squint-eyed Davy,&rdquo; a
landowner near Brecon and the scion of a family
distinguished both then and for long afterwards,
his great-grandfather having fought at Crecy and
Poitiers. He himself was a short, long-armed man
with red hair and a cast in his eye. In youth he had
been compelled to fly from Brecon for killing a
neighbour, and indeed he seemed to have enjoyed
all his life a somewhat sinister reputation for recklessness
and daring. Flying to England he was received
into the household of John of Gaunt, where
he grew up side by side with Henry of Bolingbroke
and was entirely devoted to his service. Henry,
when he came into power, had restored Gam to his
property and position in Brecon, and moreover bestowed
upon him Crown appointments in South
Wales. Glyndwr had a brother-in-law named Gam,
which has given rise to some confusion, but Davy
was at any rate no relation to the Welsh chieftain,
though, both having been in Henry&rsquo;s household, it is
probable they knew each other well.</p>

<p>Gam had hitherto and naturally been a staunch
King&rsquo;s man; he now, however, feigned conversion and
attended the parliament at Machynlleth, not to do
homage to Owen, but to kill him. The almost certain
death to which he exposed himself in case of
success prompts one to something like admiration
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>222]</a></span>
for so single-minded and fearless an avenger. But
his intentions were by some means discovered and
his rash project nipped in the bud. He was seized
and doomed to the cruel fate which the nature of
his crime made inevitable. Old friends and relatives,
however, were in strength at Machynlleth and successfully
interceded for his life. Perhaps Glyndwr
was induced to this act of clemency by the reflection
that imprisonment for an indefinite period, as practised
by himself and others at that time, was a worse
punishment than torture and death to a man of
spirit. Whether the captive lay in the dungeons of
Dolbadarn under Snowdon, at Harlech, or in the still
surviving prison house (Cachardy Owen) at Llansantffraid-Glyndyfrdwy,
we do not hear. He probably
tasted the sweets of all of them and must indeed
have spent a miserable time in those later years when
Owen was himself at bay in the mountains and more
or less of a fugitive.</p>

<p>But Davy was freed eventually, though only just
before the final disappearance of Glyndwr, and lived
to fight at the King&rsquo;s side at Agincourt together
with his son-in-law Roger Vychan, where both fell
gloriously on that memorable day. He is said to
have been knighted on the field while dying and to
be moreover the original of Shakespeare&rsquo;s Fluellin,
and to have made the memorable reply to Henry V.
when returning from a survey of the vast French
hosts just before the battle: &ldquo;There are enough to
kill, enough to take prisoners, and enough to run
away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When next Glyndwr went campaigning through
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>223]</a></span>
Brecon he took the opportunity of burning his
would-be murderer&rsquo;s mansion of Cyrnwigen. A
well-known tradition relates how, while the flames
were leaping high around the devoted homestead,
Owen addressed David Gam&rsquo;s bailiff who was gazing
disconsolately at the scene, in an <i>englyn</i>, which by
some means has found its way down to posterity
and is well known in Wales. Seeing that it is the
only instance we have of so great a patron of bards
breaking out himself into verse, I venture to print
it here. There have been various translations; this
is one of them:</p>

<div class="cpoem24">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Canst thou a little red man descry,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Looking around for his dwelling fair?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tell him it under the bank doth lie,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And its brow the mark of a coal doth bear.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>No special effort was made this spring from
England to break Glyndwr&rsquo;s power or to relieve the
castles. While some of Owen&rsquo;s captains were hovering
on the Marches, the chief himself, having dismissed
his parliament, moved with his principal
councillors to Dolgelly. Tradition still points out
the house at Machynlleth where gathered the first
and almost the only approach to a parliament that
ever met in Wales. It stands nearly opposite the
gates of Pl&acirc;s Machynlleth, an unnoticeable portion
of the street in fact, a long low building now in part
adapted to the needs of a private residence, and
having nothing suggestive about it but the thickness
of its walls. The chief outcome of this conference
at Dolgelly of &ldquo;sufficient persons&rdquo; from all over
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>224]</a></span>
Wales, was a much more formal and serious overture
to the French King than the letters of 1402.
Glyndwr had now fully donned the mantle of
royalty and wrote to the King of France as a
brother and an equal, proposing to make an offensive
and defensive alliance with him.</p>

<p>The ambassadors chosen for the conduct of this
important business were Griffith Yonge, doctor of
laws, Owen&rsquo;s Chancellor, and his own brother-in-law,
John Hanmer. The instrument is in Latin, &ldquo;Dated
at Dolgelly on the 10th day of May 1404 and in the
fourth year of our principality,&rdquo; and begins: &ldquo;Owen
by the grace of God, Prince of Wales,&rdquo; etc. The
two Welsh plenipotentiaries crossed the sea without
misadventure and were received in a most friendly
manner at Paris by the French King. His representative,
the Count de la Marche, signed the treaty
upon July 14th, together with Hanmer and Yonge,
at the house of Ferdinand de Corby, Chancellor of
France, several bishops and other notabilities being
present. By this instrument Glyndwr and the French
King entered into a solemn league and covenant to
assist each other against all the attacks of Henry of
Lancaster (Charles had never yet recognised him as
King) and his allies. The Welshmen signed the
document on behalf of &ldquo;our illustrious and most
dread Lord, Owen, Prince of Wales.&rdquo; The treaty
was ratified on the 12th of January following at
Llanbadarn near Aberystwith. The seal which
Glyndwr now used in all his transactions represents
the hero himself, with a biforked beard, seated on a
chair, holding a sceptre in his right hand and a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>225]</a></span>
globe in his left, and has recently been adopted as
the corporate arms of Machynlleth. Nor should it
be overlooked that Owen sent a list of all the chief
harbours and roads of Wales to Charles, while the
latter in return loaded the Welsh ambassadors with
presents for their master, including a gilded helmet,
a cuirass, and sword, as an earnest of his promised
help.</p>

</div>

<p>About the same time as the departure of Owen&rsquo;s
mission to France, he wrote another letter, which is
extant. It is not of much importance, except as an
illustration of the confidence he felt at this time in
his ultimate success. It is addressed to &ldquo;our dear
and entirely well beloved Henry Don,&rdquo; urging his
co-operation, and concluding with the remark: &ldquo;Their
sway is ending and victory coming to us, as from
the first, none could doubt God had so ordered.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Among other signs of Glyndwr&rsquo;s increased importance
this year, was the coming over to his cause of
that Tudor Trevor, Bishop of St. Asaph, who it will
be remembered had warned the King and his council
against despising Owen&rsquo;s peaceful appeal for
justice against Grey of Ruthin, and urgently protested
against those ill-fated and misplaced sneers at
the &ldquo;barfoots.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was Trevor&rsquo;s cathedral at St. Asaph, of course,
and its precincts, which Glyndwr had so ruthlessly
burned in 1402. The Bishop had since then been
not only supported by grants from the English
exchequer, but had well earned them by much
serious official work in the King&rsquo;s service. Whether
his Welsh blood warmed at the prospects of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>226]</a></span>
revived Cambrian independence or whether ambition
was the keynote of his actions, no one may
know. At any rate it was not want or neglect at
the hands of the King that drove him back into the
arms of Owen. The latter gave him a cordial welcome,
and it must be said for Trevor that through
good and ill he proved faithful to his new master&rsquo;s
cause. Militant clerics were common enough in
those times. Trevor, with the martial instincts of
the great border race from which he sprang, and
whose history is written deep for centuries beside
the Ceiriog and the Dee, had been in the thick of
the fight at Shrewsbury beneath the King&rsquo;s banner.
He now followed Glyndwr both in the council and
in the field, dying eventually in Paris, a fugitive and
an exile, in the year 1410.</p>

<p>All through this spring Owen&rsquo;s followers on the
borders were making life upon the English side intolerable.
Bonfires were laid ready for the match
on every hill. The thirty towers and castles that
guarded Shropshire were helpless to stem the tide.
The county was again laid waste to the very walls
of Shrewsbury and many of the population fled to
other parts of England for a livelihood. Archdeacon
Kingeston at Hereford once again takes up his pen
and paints a lamentable picture:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The Welsh rebels in great numbers have entered
Archenfield [a division of the county] and there they
have burnt houses, killed the inhabitants, taken prisoners
and ravaged the country to the great dishonour of
our King and the unsupportable damage of the country.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>227]</a></span>
We have often advertised the King that such mischief
would befall us, we have also now certain information
that within the next eight days the rebels are resolved to
make an attack in the March of Wales to its utter ruin,
if speedy succour be not sent. True it is indeed that
we have no power to shelter us except that of Lord
Richard of York and his men, which is far too little to
defend us; we implore you to consider this very perilous
and pitiable case and to pray our Sovereign Lord
that he will come in his Royal person or send some person
with sufficient power to rescue us from the invasion
of the said rebels. Otherwise we shall be utterly destroyed,
which God forbid; whoever comes will as we are
led to believe have to engage in battle, or will have a
very severe struggle with the rebels. And for God&rsquo;s
sake remember that honourable and valiant man, the
Lord Abergavenny [William Beauchamp], who is on the
very point of destruction if he be not rescued. Written
in haste at Hereford, June 10th.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A fortnight later the dread of Owen&rsquo;s advance
was emphasised by Prince Henry himself, who was
still, in conjunction with the Duke of York, in charge
of the Welsh wars.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Most dread and sovereign Lord and Father, at
your high command in your other gracious letters, I
have removed with my small household to the city
of Worcester, and may it please your Royal Highness
to know that the Welsh have made a descent
on Herefordshire, burning and destroying the county
with very great force, and with a supply of provisions
for fifteen days.&rdquo; The Prince goes on to say that
the Welsh are assembled with all their power, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>228]</a></span>
to save the county of Hereford he has sent for all
sorts of considerable persons (mentioned by name)
to meet him at Worcester. In conjunction with these
he tells the King he will &ldquo;do to the utmost of his
little power,&rdquo; and then comes the inevitable want of
money and the impossibility of maintaining troops
in the field or meeting the expenses of the garrisons.
Another letter from the same hand a few days afterwards
warned the King still more urgently of the
pressing danger and declared how impossible it was
to keep his troops upon the frontier without pay or
provisions.</p>

<p>There is no evidence that these strong representations
brought any satisfaction to the anxious writers.
The sieges of those castles not yet taken Owen continued
to prosecute with vigour, while his captains
continued to desolate the border counties. Glyndwr
was much too skilful a strategist to undertake a
serious expedition into England. The cause of
Richard and Mortimer, which would have been his
only war-cry, had been shattered, so far as England
was concerned, at Shrewsbury. All Glyndwr wanted
was Wales, and at present he virtually possessed it.
He felt confident now, moreover, of substantial
assistance from the French King, and when that
arrived he might perhaps take the initiative seriously
against Henry on behalf of his son-in-law&rsquo;s family.
Nor is there any doubt but that he was greatly indebted
for the extraordinary position he had
achieved to the chronic impecuniosity of his enemy,
and perhaps indeed to his own reputation for magic
art. Who can say?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>229]</a></span>
One brief and spirited campaign, however, distinguished
this summer, or more probably the late
spring of 1404, for the actual date is uncertain.
It was undertaken by a strong force which Beauchamp,
Earl of Warwick, led right through the
present county of Montgomery. Glyndwr threw
himself across the Earl&rsquo;s path at Mynydd-cwm-du
(&ldquo;the black mountain hollow&rdquo;): a fierce battle ensued,
in which the Welsh were defeated and were so
closely pressed that Owen&rsquo;s banner was captured and
he himself very nearly taken. Warwick does not
seem to have followed up his advantage; on the
contrary, Glyndwr, rallying his men, followed the
Earl back to the Herefordshire border whither
the usual lack of provender had sent him, and there
turned the tables on his enemy, beating him badly
in a pitched battle at Craig-y-dorth. The scene of
this second encounter is on the road between Chepstow
and Monmouth, near Trelog common.</p>

<p>Early in August, 1404, the Shropshire Marches
were so sorely pressed, and the English defences so
worn out, that the council were compelled to listen
to the urgent appeals of the Salopians and grant the
people of that county leave to make terms with
Owen on their own account and pay him exemption
money. The same privilege had also to be extended
to Edward de Charleton, Lord of Powys, who from
his &ldquo;Castle de la Pole&rdquo; (Welshpool) made a truce
with the Welsh. It is worthy of note that the
people of Welshpool, though practically all of Welsh
blood, stood by their lord and resisted Owen
throughout the whole of the struggle. For this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>230]</a></span>
reason Charleton gave them a fresh charter immensely
enlarging the boundaries of the borough,
which to this day occupies the unique position of extending
over something like twenty thousand acres.</p>

<p>Towards the end of August, King Henry was
forced once more to turn his attention to Wales.
The scandal and the danger were growing grievous.
So he held a council at Tutbury, the minutes of
which are significant. Eight bishops, eighteen abbots
and priors, nineteen great lords and barons, and
ninety-six representatives of counties, we are told,
attended it. The news was here confirmed that the
French had equipped sixty vessels in the port of
Harfleur and were about to fill them with soldiers
and proceed to Owen&rsquo;s assistance. It was decided,
however, that since the King was not at present able
to raise an army sufficiently imposing for his high
estate, he should remain at Tutbury till the
meeting of Parliament in October. As campaigning
against Owen even in the summer season had sufficient
horrors for the King, the logic of deferring the
expedition till November can only be explained by
sheer lack of money. At least one would have supposed
so if Henry had not burked the whole question,
turned his back once more on his lost and
desolated province, and hastened to the North.</p>

<p>Prince John, the King&rsquo;s second son, was now
joined with Prince Henry in the titular Governorship
of the South Wales Marches, and the royal
brothers were voted two thousand five hundred
archers and men-at-arms. How many of these they
got is another story, of which we have no certain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>231]</a></span>
knowledge. For a fortnight it was all they could do
to hold their own as they pushed slowly through to
the relief of Coity Castle (now Oldcastle Bridgend),
which was being bravely defended by Sir Alexander
Berkrolles.</p>

<p>With the exception of the chronic pressure on the
still resisting castles, this autumn and winter was
comparatively quiet in Wales, for the excellent
reason that Owen had it all his own way. Aberystwith
had fallen soon after Harlech; and those of
my readers who are familiar with the wave-washed
situation of the ruins of the later Norman castle
which still mark the site of the ancient palace of
Cadwallader, may well wonder why a spot so accessible
from a score of English seaports should have
been abandoned to its fate. The tower and monastery
of Llanbadarn, too, hard by, became a favourite
resting-place of Owen&rsquo;s at this time, and it was here
he ratified this winter his treaty with the King of
France. But as his family and that of Mortimer
would appear to have made Harlech their headquarters,
and as later on he summoned his second
parliament to that historic spot, it is more than likely
that the late autumn and winter months saw the old
castle the gathering-point of the bards, and the rallying-place
of Owen&rsquo;s faithful captains&mdash;a court, in fact,
and one more adequately housed by far than that
other one at the mansion on the Dee, since reduced
to a heap of ashes. As one wanders to-day amid
the grim walls of Harlech and presses the soft turf
that centuries of sun and showers and sea mists have
spread over what was once the floor of its great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>232]</a></span>
banqueting hall, the scenes that it must have witnessed
in this winter of 1404 are well calculated to stir the
fancy and captivate the imagination. Death and
battle have been in ancient times busy enough
around the rock of Harlech and upon the green
slopes of the Ardudwy Mountains that from high
above its grey towers look out upon the sea. From
the days of Br&acirc;n the Blessed, the first Christian
Prince, whose fortress, Twr Bronwen, men say, stood
upon this matchless site, till those of the fighting
Maelgwyn, King of Gwynedd, when the coasts of
Wales were strewn with the victims of plague and
battle, it was a notable spot. From Colwyn ap
Tangno, the fountainhead of half the pedigrees in
North-west Wales, till forty years after Glyndwr&rsquo;s
time, when, in the Wars of the Roses, David ap
Sinion made that celebrated defence against Lord
Herbert which inspired the writing of the stirring
and immortal march, Harlech was a focus of strife,
the delight of the bard, the glory of the minstrel.
Of all Welsh castles, save the fragment of Dinas
Br&acirc;n,&mdash;and that is indeed saying much,&mdash;it is the
most proudly placed; and the great medieval fortress,
still in its exterior so perfect, is well worthy of its site.
Amid a pile of mountains to the north Snowdon
lifts its shapely peak; far westward into the shining
sea stretches the long arm of West Carnarvon,
throwing up here and there its shadowy outstanding
peaks till it fades into the dim horizon behind which
Ireland lies. As the eye travels southward, the
lofty headlands of Merioneth give way to the
fainter capes of Cardigan, and upon the verge of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>233]</a></span>
sight in clear weather the wild coast of Pembroke,
its rugged outline softened by distance, lies low between
sea and sky.</p>

</div>

<p>Those to whom such things appeal will see much
that is appropriate in the gathering of Glyndwr, his
bards, his warriors, his priests, his counsellors, at
Harlech during this winter which perhaps marked
the high-tide of his renown. His wife, &ldquo;the best of
wives,&rdquo; with the fair Katherine, wife of Mortimer,
was here, and a crowd of dames, we may be well assured,
whose manors were not at that time, with
their husbands in the field, the safest of abodes for
lonely females. Owen&rsquo;s three married daughters
were not here, for the Scudamores, Monningtons,
and Crofts, whose names they bore, being Herefordshire
men, were all upon the other side. Edmund
Mortimer, of course, was present, and it is strange
how a soldier of such repute and of so vigorous
a stock should have sunk his individuality so absolutely
in that of his masterful father-in-law.
Glyndwr&rsquo;s two elder sons, now grown to man&rsquo;s estate,
Griffith and Meredith, and his own younger
brother, Tudor, who was soon to fall, with his
brother-in-law, John Hanmer, just returned from his
French mission, complete the family group that
we may be fairly justified in picturing at Harlech,
assembled round the person of their now
crowned Prince. Rhys Gethin, the victor of Pilleth
and the terror of the South Wales Marches, was
probably there, and the two Tudors of Penmynydd,
whom from first to last several thousand men had
followed across the Menai from the still unmolested
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>234]</a></span>
fields of Anglesey. Yonge the Chancellor, too, fresh
from France, Llewelyn Bifort, whom, with the consent
of the Avignon Pope, Owen had nominated to
the wasted estate and the burnt cathedral of Bangor,
and Bishop Trevor of St. Asaph, most eminent of
them all, were at Harlech beyond a doubt. Robert
ap Jevan of Ystymtegid in Eivioneth was most
probably there, with Rhys Dwy, &ldquo;a great master
among them,&rdquo; who was executed in London eight
years later, and last, but by no means least, Owen&rsquo;s
faithful laureate, Griffith Llwyd, or &ldquo;Iolo Goch,&rdquo;
who, among all the bards that had tuned their
voices and their harps to Owen&rsquo;s praise and been
stirred to ecstasy by his successes, stood first and
chief.</p>

<p>Glyndwr had in truth no cause to complain of
his chief bard, who was a veteran in song when war
came to stimulate him to patriotic frenzy, and the
stirring tones in which he sang of his Prince&rsquo;s deeds
were echoed by every native harp in Wales.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>Though a metrical translation may be unsatisfactory
enough to the Celtic scholar, this rendering will not
be without interest to English readers as giving the
sense, at any rate, of words addressed to Glyndwr by
the man nearest to his person. The fourteenth century
was the halcyon period of Welsh song; Dafydd
ap Gwylim, the greatest of all Welsh love-poets, was
still alive in Glyndwr&rsquo;s youth, while Gutyn Owen was
almost a contemporary. Welsh poetry had attuned
itself, since the Edwardian conquest had brought
comparative peace in Wales, to gentler and more
literary themes. The joys of agriculture and country
life, the happiness of the peasant, the song of birds,
the murmur of streams, and, above all, the gentler
passions of human nature had supplanted to a great
extent the fiercer notes of martial eulogies, the p&aelig;ans
of victory, and the plaintive wails over long-past but
unforgotten defeats. It is strange, too, that this flow
of song should have signalised a century when the
profession of a wandering minstrel was in Wales for
the first time ostracised by law.</p>

<p>But the old martial minstrelsy was not dead. The
yearning of the soldier and the man of ancient race
to emulate the deeds or the supposed deeds of his
predecessors, and to be the subject after death of
bardic eulogy in hall or castle, was still strong. It
helped many a warrior to meet with cheerfulness a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>236]</a></span>
bloody death, or with the memory of heroic deeds
performed to sink with resignation at the hands of
disease or old age into the cold grave.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII<br />
<br />
<span class="vsmlfont">WELSH REVERSES<br />
1405</span></h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">G</span>LYNDWR was now, by the lowest estimate, in
his forty-sixth year. For that period, when
manhood began early, and old age, if it
came at all, came quickly, he certainly carried his
years with remarkable lightness. Who can say,
however, with what feelings he surveyed his handiwork?
From end to end, with almost the sole
exception of Anglesey and Carnarvonshire and
western Pembroke, Wales lay desolate and bleeding.
Owen&rsquo;s hands were red, not only with the
blood of Saxons, but with that of old friends and
even kinsmen. Red ravage had marked his steps,
and there were few parts of the country that he had
not at some time or other crossed and recrossed in
his desolating marches. Carnarvonshire and western
Merioneth and the Plinlimmon Mountains were
full of booty, stock, and valuables brought from
Norman-Welsh lordships and from beyond the English
border. The admirers of Glyndwr would fain
believe, and there is something to be said for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>238]</a></span>
theory, that passion and revenge had no part in the
havoc which the Welsh hero spread throughout his
native land, but that it was due to a deliberate
scheme of campaign by which the country was to be
made not only too hot, but too bare, to hold the
Saxon.</p>

<p>It would be waste of words to speculate on motives
that can never be divulged and schemes that
have left no witnesses. We have at any rate to face
tradition, which counts for much. And this places
Glyndwr in the eyes of most Welshmen, with all his
ravagings and burnings, on a pedestal above the
greatest and most patriotic of their older Princes&mdash;above
Llewelyn ap Iorwerth, above the last Llewelyn,
the son of Gryffydd, above Owen Gwynedd.
The cool-headed student may be much less enthusiastic.
But he will also call to mind the ethics of
war in those days, and then perhaps remember that
even in modern conflicts, whose memories stand out
with conspicuous glory, there has been no very
great improvement on the methods of Glyndwr.
The Carolinian who preferred King George to Washington
and Congress&mdash;and King George after all was
at least no usurper&mdash;suffered neither more nor less
than the Welshmen of Glamorgan or Carmarthen
or Merioneth who from prudence or inclination preferred
Bolingbroke to Glyndwr. Wars of this type
have ever been ferocious. The Anglo-Americans of
the eighteenth century were a civilised and peaceful
people; Glyndwr lived at a time when war was a
trade, ravage its handmaid, and human life of but
small account.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>239]</a></span>
It is quite possible to overestimate the effect upon
a country in those days of even the most merciless
treatment. The torch was not the instrument
of irreparable loss that it would have been if applied
with equal freedom only a hundred and fifty years
later. Outside the feudal castles and the great
ecclesiastical foundations, there were few permanent
structures of much value either in England or Wales.
It was late in the century with which we are dealing
before the manor-house and grange of the yeoman or
country gentleman became buildings of the style
with which careless fancy is apt to associate their
names. It is salutary sometimes to leave the ordinary
paths of history and refresh one&rsquo;s mind with
the domestic realities of olden days as they are
shown to us by writers who have given their attention
to such humble but helpful details. The ordinary
English manor-house of Glyndwr&rsquo;s time was a
plain wooden building,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> with an escape-hole in the
thatched roof for the smoke, a floor covered with
rushes, and filthy from lack of change, with bare
boards laid on rude supports doing duty as tables.
A little tapestry sometimes relieved the crudeness of
the bare interior where such a crowd of human beings
often gathered together. Here and there an
important person built for himself a compromise between
a manor and a castle, Glyndwr himself being
an instance to the point. The average manor-houses
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>240]</a></span>
of Wales, the abodes of the native gentry, were certainly
no more, probably less, luxurious, and not often&mdash;though
some were even then&mdash;built of stone.
As for the peasantry, their dwellings in either the
England or Wales of that time were mere huts
of mud, wood, or wattle, and were often, no doubt,
not worth the trouble of destroying.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_13_13" id="Footnote_13_13"></a><a href="#FNanchor_13_13"><span class="label">[13]</span></a>
Mr. Denton, in his <i>England of the Fifteenth Century</i>, allows no
more than four, and usually only three rooms, to an average manor-house:
one for eating in, with a second, and perhaps a third, for
sleeping; a fire in the centre of the first. <a href="#FNanchor_13_13">Back</a></p>
</div>

<p>The Welsh of those days, unlike the English, did
not group themselves in villages. Each man not an
actual servant, whether he were gentleman or small
yeoman, lived apart upon his property or holding.
If we eliminate the present towns, the country must
have been in most parts almost as thickly populated
as it is now. A valuable survival, known as the
<i>Record of Carnarvon</i>, a sort of local doomsday book,
dating from the thirteenth century, may be seen to-day,
and it gives very detailed information as to
the persons, manors, and freeholds of that country,
and some idea of how well peopled for the times
was even the wildest part of wild Wales. Prince
Henry, it will be remembered, speaks of the Vale of
Edeyrnion as a fine and populous country. Giraldus
Cambrensis, in his graphic account of his tour with
Archbishop Baldwin in the twelfth century, gives the
same impression. Still the destruction of such buildings
as the mass of its people lived in, even if they
were destroyed, was of no vital consequence. The
loss of a year&rsquo;s crop was not irreparable, particularly
in a country where sheep and cattle, which could
often be driven away, were the chief assets of rural
life. Glyndwr, to be sure, did what few other makers
of war, even in Wales, had done, for he destroyed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>241]</a></span>
some of the chief ecclesiastical buildings. He burnt,
moreover, several of the small towns and dismantled
many castles. &ldquo;Deflower&rsquo;d by Glindor&rdquo; is a remark
frequently in the mouth of old Leland as he
went on his immortal survey not much more than a
hundred years later.</p>

<p>The term &ldquo;rebel,&rdquo; as applied to Glyndwr and
those Welshmen who followed him, is more convenient
than logical. However bad a king Richard
may have been, the Welsh had never wavered in
their allegiance to him. However excellent a monarch
Henry might have made if he had been given
the chance, he was at least an usurper, and a breaker
of his word. London and parts of England had
welcomed him to the throne. The Percys and innumerable
other Englishmen who then and at various
other times conspired against him were rebels
beyond a doubt. But the Welsh had never even
been consulted in the <i>coup d&rsquo;&eacute;tat</i> by which he seized
the crown. They had never recognised him as king
nor sworn allegiance. To them he was simply an
usurper and the almost certain assassin of their late
King. If Richard were alive, then Henry could not
be their lawful sovereign. If, on the other hand, he
had been done to death, which either directly or indirectly
he surely had been, then the boy Earl of
March, as all the world knew, should be on the
throne. Henry of Monmouth, too, being the son of
an usurper, could not possibly be Prince of Wales.
The place was vacant, and the opportunity for electing
one of their own race and blood was too good to
be missed. Whatever historians may choose to call
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>242]</a></span>
Glyndwr, he was logically no rebel in a period when
allegiance was almost wholly a personal matter. His
enemies, whom he hunted out of Wales or pent up
in their castles, were, on the other hand, from his
point of view, rebels and traitors in recognising the
authority and protection of an usurper. The Welsh
people owed no allegiance to the English, but to the
King of England and Wales, to whom for the protection
of the isle of Britain, as the old tradition
still ran, they paid a sum of &pound;60,000 a year. In
their eyes, as in those of many persons in England
and of most in Europe, Henry was Henry of Lancaster,
not King of England. The Welsh tribute, it
is hardly necessary to say, had dwindled, since the
rising of Glyndwr, to insignificant proportions, while
the war expenses it entailed, together with this loss
of income, was one of the chief causes of that impecuniosity
which prevented Henry from ever really
showing of what stuff as a ruler he was made.</p>

<p>The chief incident of the early part of the year
1405 was a nearly successful plot to carry off from
the King&rsquo;s keeping the young Earl of March, the
rightful heir to the crown, and his brother. Being
nephews of Sir Edmund Mortimer, the attempt to
bring them to Glyndwr&rsquo;s headquarters in Wales and
to the protection of their uncle was a natural one.
The King, who was spending Christmas at Eltham,
had left the boys behind him at Windsor, under the
charge of Hugh de Waterton, Constable of the
Castle. Their domestic guardian was the widow of
the Lord Despencer and sister of the Duke of York,
who at this time, it will be remembered, was in joint
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>243]</a></span>
charge with Prince Henry of Welsh affairs. The
Despencers had been Norman-Welsh barons for
some generations, their interests at this time lying
for the most part in what is now Monmouthshire,
and though ostensibly hostile, they had old ties of
blood and propinquity with the house of Mortimer.
This Christmas witnessed one of the many plots
against the King&rsquo;s life, but with these we have nothing
to do, except in so far that the moment was regarded
as being a favourable one for making an effort to get
hold of the two royal boys. How unstable were
Henry&rsquo;s friends for the most part may be gathered
from the fact that the Duke of York, his trusted representative
in Wales, was himself privy to the scheme.</p>

<p>To Lady Despencer was entrusted the chief part
in this dangerous work. As sister to the Duke of
York, she was in the King&rsquo;s eyes above all suspicion.
When the latter had left Windsor for Eltham she
caused a locksmith secretly to make false keys, and
by means of these, with the connivance of some servants,
she contrived to get her two wards safely out of
the castle precincts, taking with her at the same time
her own son. Horses and attendants were ready in
waiting, and the whole party pushed for the West
with all the expedition of which they were capable.
They had passed through Berkshire before the King
heard the news of their escape. When it reached
him, however, no time was lost. Sending out swift
messengers upon the track of the fugitives he himself
at once hastened to Windsor. The pursuers
were just in time and overtook the illustrious fugitives
in Gloucestershire within a day&rsquo;s ride of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>244]</a></span>
security which Mortimer and Glyndwr&rsquo;s people were
waiting to afford them in Wales. A lively brush,
not without slaughter on both sides, signalised the
meeting, but the lady and the boys were captured
and conveyed back to London. Lady Despencer
then revealed the plot to murder the King, denouncing
her brother, the Duke of York, as a leading conspirator.
This was not a sisterly action, and the
Duke loudly denied all knowledge of such dastardly
intentions. At this the lady, whose private reputation
was not all that it should have been, waxed indignant
and clamorously demanded a champion to
maintain her declaration with lance and sword.
Whereupon a gentleman named William Maidstone
flung down his glove to the Duke in the very
presence of the King. The challenge was accepted,
but, the Duke being apparently of corpulent build
and the challenger both at a physical advantage and
of no distinction, the romantic combat never took
place. Perhaps the King wished to get the Duke
into his hands without loss of time, for he seized
him and sent him to the Tower instead of into the
lists. He was soon, however, as an illustration of
how forgiving Henry could at times be, pardoned
and reinstated to the full in all his honours. His
sister, however, whose tenants were nearly all supporters
of Glyndwr, was stripped of her property.
But they, too, were eventually restored, and their
feudal superior, who made no little stir in her time,
lies buried amid the ruins of the old abbey at Reading.
The unfortunate locksmith who had made the
keys had both his hands chopped off.</p>

The castles of Caerleon, Caerphilly, Newport, and
Usk had fallen, and in the manuscripts collected by
Iolo Morganwg (Edward Williams), who flourished in
the last century, an apparently contemporaneous
though anonymous writer, has somewhat to say about
Glyndwr in Morganwg or Glamorgan. He tells how
Owen came to Cardiff, &ldquo;destroyed it and won the
castle,&rdquo; demolishing at the same time the castles of
Penllan, Llandochau, Flemington, Dunraven of the
Butlers, Tal-y-fan, Llanblethian, Llangeinor, Malefant,
and Penmark, and burning many villages the
men of which would not join him. &ldquo;The country
people collected round him with one accord and demolished
houses and castles innumerable, laid waste
and quite fenceless the lands, and gave them in common
to all.&rdquo; The manuscript goes on to say how
Glyndwr &ldquo;took away from the rich and powerful and
distributed the plunder among the weak and poor.&rdquo;
Many of the higher orders of chieftains had to fly to
England under the protection and support of the
King. A bloody battle took place at Bryn Owen
(Stallingdown) near Cowbridge, between Glyndwr
and the King&rsquo;s men. The latter were put to flight
after eighteen hours&rsquo; hard fighting, &ldquo;during which the
blood was up to the horses&rsquo; fetlocks at Pant-y-wenol,
that separates both ends of the mountain.&rdquo; Here beyond
a doubt was a fulfilment of one of the dread
portents that attended Owen&rsquo;s birth, when the horses,
it will be remembered, in his father&rsquo;s stable were
found standing with the blood running over their
feet. There is no date to this anonymous but evidently
sincere and suggestive narrative, or rather the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>246]</a></span>
date assigned to the event is evidently an error.
The matters here spoken of belong to 1403, or 1404,
in all probability, though they can only be inserted
parenthetically as one of those scraps of local Welsh
testimony from the period itself that have an interest
of their own.</p>

<p>The year 1405 opened with reports that the renowned
Rhys Gethin was to cross the English border
with a large force. Prince Henry, now eighteen
years of age, with an experience of war under difficulties
and of carking cares of state such as has
fallen to the lot of few men so young, prepared to
make ready for him. Short of men and money, the
young soldier had long begun to show of what
mettle he was made and to give evidence of the ability
that was eventually to do more to arrest the resistance
of Glyndwr than all the combined efforts of
Lord Marchers and their royal master.</p>

<p>Rumour on this occasion proved true, for Rhys,
passing through Glamorgan with eight thousand men
and skirting Abergavenny, attacked the border town
of Grosmont, in the valley of the Monnow, and burnt
it to the ground. Grosmont had hitherto been a
flourishing place, but it never recovered from the
blow then dealt it. In Camden&rsquo;s time the remains of
streets and causeways could be traced beneath the
turf of the surrounding fields in evidence of its
vanished glories. To-day it is a picturesque and
peaceful village crowning a high ridge, from which
a glorious prospect can be enjoyed of the vale of the
Monnow with the sparkling river hurrying downwards
between lofty hills to meet the Wye. A
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>247]</a></span>
simple street, and that a short one, is all that remains,
while an old town hall speaks eloquently of its departed
importance. A cruciform church of great age
with an octagonal tower and spire springing from the
centre lends force to the tradition of Grosmont&rsquo;s
former glories. Above all, the walls of the Norman
castle, whence issued Prince Henry&rsquo;s gallant band,
still stand hard by the village, their reddish stonework
half hidden amid a mass of ivy and the foliage
of embowering trees; the moat half full of the leaves
of many autumns, the ramparts green with the
turf of ages; a quiet enough spot now but for the
song of birds and the tumble of the river upon its
rocks three hundred feet below. It was here that
Glyndwr&rsquo;s forces met with their first serious disaster
upon the border, for the Prince, together with Gilbert
Talbot and Sir Edward Newport, sallying out of the
castle, attacked Rhys Gethin and inflicted upon the
Welsh a severe and bloody defeat, completely routing
them with a loss of eight hundred men left dead
upon the field. It is especially stated in some accounts
that no quarter was given, and only one prisoner taken
alive and spared for ransom, of whom Prince Henry,
in a letter to his father which is worth transcribing,
speaks as &ldquo;a great chieftain.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;My most redoubted and most Sovereign Lord and
father, I sincerely pray that God will graciously show His
miraculous aid towards you in all places, praised be He
in all His works, for on Wednesday the eleventh of this
present month of March, your rebels of the parts of
Glamorgan, Morgannok, Usk, Netherwent, and Overwent,
assembled to the number of eight thousand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>248]</a></span>
men, according to their own account, and they went on
the same Wednesday, in the morning, and burnt a part
of your town of Grossmont within your Lordship of
Monmouth and Jennoia [<i>sic</i>]. Presently went out my well
beloved cousin the Lord Talbot and the small body of
my household, and with them joined your faithful and
valiant knights William Newport and John Greindor, the
which formed but a small power in the whole; but true
it is indeed that victory is not in the multitude of people,
and this was well proved there, but in the power of God,
and there by the aid of the blessed Trinity, your people
gained the field, and vanquished all the said rebels, and
slew of them by fair account in field, by the time of their
return from the pursuit, some say eight hundred,
others a thousand, being questioned upon pain of
death; nevertheless whether it were one or the other
I will not contend, and to inform you fully of all that has
been done, I send you a person worthy of credit therein,
my faithful servant the bearer of this letter, who was at
the engagement and performed his duty well, as he has
always done. And such amends has God ordained you
for the burning of your houses in your aforesaid town,
and of prisoners were none taken except one, a great chief
among them, whom I would have sent to you but he cannot
yet ride at ease.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Written at Hereford the said Wednesday at night.</p>

<p class="sig2">&ldquo;Your most humble and obedient son,</p>

<p class="sig">&ldquo;Henry.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Glyndwr, as soon as he heard of the disaster on the
Monnow, pushed up fresh forces under his brother
Tudor to meet the fugitives from Grosmont, with
a view to wipe out, if possible, that crushing defeat.
What strength they got, if any, from Rhys Gethin&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>249]</a></span>
scattered army there is no evidence, but in less than
a week they encountered the Prince himself advancing
into Wales with a considerable force, and at
Mynydd-y-Pwll-Melyn, in Brecon, received a defeat
more calamitous than even that of Grosmont. Fifteen
hundred of the Welsh were killed or taken prisoners.
Among the slain was Owen&rsquo;s brother Tudor
himself; and so like the chief was he in face and
form that for some time there was much rejoicing,
and the news was bruited about that the dreaded
Glyndwr was in truth dead. The spirits of the English
were sadly damped when the absence of a wart
under the left eye, a distinguishing mark of Glyndwr,
proclaimed that their joy was premature, and that it
was the dead face of his younger brother on which
they were gazing. Among the prisoners, however,
was his son Gryffydd, who was sent by the Prince to
London and confined in the Tower, statements of
money allowed for his maintenance there appearing
from time to time on the Rolls. Gryffydd&rsquo;s (Griffin
he is there called) fellow-prisoner is Owen ap Gryffydd,
the son probably of the valiant Cardiganshire
gentleman whom Henry quartered in 1402. A year
later the young King of Scotland, whose life was
safer there, no doubt, than in his own country, was the
companion of Glyndwr&rsquo;s son. The Iolo manuscript
before mentioned tells us:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;In 1405 a bloody battle attended with great slaughter
that in severity was scarcely ever exceeded in Wales
took place on Pwll Melin; Gryffyth ap Owen and his
men were taken and many of them imprisoned, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>250]</a></span>
many were put to death when captured, whereupon all
Glamorgan turned Saxon except a small number who
followed their lord to North Wales.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These two severe defeats were a great blow to
Owen&rsquo;s prestige. They caused numbers of his adherents
in South Wales to fall away and to seek that
pardon which the King, to do him justice, was at all
times very free in extending to Welshmen. Indeed,
it would almost seem as if he himself secretly recognised
the fact that they had much justice on their
side and were rebels rather in name than in actual
fact.</p>

<p>About the time of the second of these two victories
over the Welsh, the King, encouraged no doubt
by such successes, began making great preparations
for a personal expedition against Glyndwr. His activity
in other parts, for the North was always simmering,
had been prodigious. He now arrived at
Hereford early in May, full of determination to support
in person the zeal so lately aroused in his hard-worked
constables and lieutenants, and once and for
all to suppress the accursed magician who for five
years had so entirely got the better of him.</p>

<p>But Glyndwr previous to these defeats had sent
emissaries to the North. Three of his immediate
councillors were in Northumberland in secret conclave
with its crafty and ill-advised Earl. The King,
it will be remembered, had not only forgiven Percy
but had restored to him all his confiscated estates.
That he was prepared again to risk the substance for
the shadow (to say nothing of committing an act of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>251]</a></span>
ingratitude that even for those days was indecent)
is conclusive evidence that his dead son, Hotspur, was
not the evil genius his father had with poor spirit
represented him to be when craving mercy from the
King. Glyndwr, however, had nothing to do with
the old Earl&rsquo;s conscience when for the second time
he seemed anxious for an alliance. Bishop Trevor,
with Bifort, Glyndwr&rsquo;s Bishop of Bangor, and David
Daron, Dean of Bangor, were now all in the North
intriguing with Northumberland. In the early days
of the Welsh rising Glyndwr seemed to have some
personal and even sentimental leaning towards the
Percys. There was nothing of that, however, in his
present attitude, which was purely a business one,
seeing that the French, as he thought, and rightly
so, were on the point of coming to his assistance,
and the North about to rise in arms against Henry.
Even the loss of men and of his own prestige, entailed
by the defeats of Grosmont and Pwll-Melyn
and the falling away of Glamorgan, might be much
more than counterbalanced. The first mutterings of
the outbreak came from York, but they were loud
enough to pull the King up at Hereford and start
him at full speed for Yorkshire. Once more his
sorely tried servants in Wales had to do as best they
could without him, though some compensation in
the way of men and supplies was sent to their relief.
It is not within my province to follow Henry&rsquo;s
operations this summer in the North, but it is necessary
to our narrative to state that Percy escaped
from York only just in time, having refused the
really magnanimous conditions of pardon that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>252]</a></span>
King sent on to him. He fled to Scotland, taking
with him his fellow-conspirator, Earl Bardolph, and
Glyndwr&rsquo;s three emissaries, Trevor, Bifort, and David
Daron. Another Welshman of Owen&rsquo;s party, however,
who has not been hitherto mentioned, Sir John
Griffith, was caught at York and executed. Many
persons besides Percy were implicated in the plot,
Archbishop Scrope for one, whose execution, with
many accompanying indignities, sent a thrill of horror
throughout Britain and Europe; Judge Gascoine&rsquo;s
courageous refusal to sentence the prelate
being, of course, one of the familiar incidents of the
reign. For the second time the Percy estates were
confiscated, while the suppression of the revolt and
the punishment of the rebels kept the King lingering
for a long time in the North. At the end of
July he received the serious news that the French
had landed in South Wales, and, hurrying southward,
reached Worcester about the 10th of August, to
find Glyndwr with some ten thousand Welshmen and
nearly half as many French within nine miles of that
city.</p>

<p>We must now return to Wales and to the earlier
part of the summer, that we may learn how this
transformation came about within so short a time.
After Glyndwr&rsquo;s two defeats in March, and the subsequent
panic among the men of Glamorgan and
no doubt also among those of Gwent and parts of
Brycheiniog, the chieftain himself with a following
of tried and still trusty men went to North Wales.
Welsh historians, following one another, paint most
dismal pictures of Owen this summer, representing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>253]</a></span>
him as a solitary wanderer, travelling incognito
about the country, sometimes alone, sometimes
with a handful of faithful followers, now lurking in
friends&rsquo; houses, now hiding in mountain caverns, but
always dogged by relentless foes. All these things
he did in after years with sufficient tenacity to
satisfy the most enthusiastic lover of romance. That
his condition can have come to such a pass in the
summer of 1405 is too manifestly absurd to be worth
discussion. He had received, it is true, a blow
severe enough to discourage the localities near
which it happened, and probably to frighten a good
many of his friends in other parts. It is possible,
too, some may have sued secretly for pardon. But
when we consider that in March all Wales except
certain castles was faithful, and that his troops were
attacking the English border when repulsed; that in
May the King and his lieutenants were only preparing
to invade Wales; that no operations of moment
were so far as we know executed during the early
summer against the Welsh; and finally that in July
Glyndwr met the French at Tenby with ten thousand
men behind him, it is quite incredible that 1405
can have been the season in which he spent months
as an outcast and a wanderer. We may, I think, take
it as certain that Glyndwr&rsquo;s star had not yet sensibly
declined, and that what he had recently lost might
well be considered as more than cancelled by the appearance
in Milford Bay of 140 French ships full of
soldiers.</p>

<p>While the coming of the French was still an uncertainty,
it is probable that there was considerable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>254]</a></span>
depression even among Owen&rsquo;s immediate followers.
But neither he nor they were cherishing it in caves
and solitudes. On the contrary, another parliament,
similarly constituted to the former one at Machynlleth,
was summoned to Harlech. Of the result of
its deliberations we know nothing, but a letter of the
period suggests that Glyndwr was not wholly without
thought of making terms in case of the non-arrival
of the French. At the same time this is not
quite in keeping with the stubborn resistance that
in after years, when all hope had fled, he maintained
with such heroic fortitude. Two of the county representatives,
at any rate, who came to Harlech on
this occasion were trimmers or worse. David Whitmore
and Ievan ap Meredydd were supposed to represent
his interests in Flint, but we are told that,
before departing for the West, they held private
communication with Sir John Stanley, who was in
charge of the important castle of Hope for the King.
To be brief, they went as spies rather than as supporters,
and with the intention of keeping the English
informed of what took place. But it was now
already summer and while this season was still at its
height, the event which Glyndwr was hoping and
looking for took place.</p>

<p>The French had made many attempts in the preceding
year to reach Wales; a few, as we know,
touched the coast, and lent some slight assistance at
Carnarvon and elsewhere. Now, however, a more
successful effort and upon an infinitely larger scale
was made, and 140 ships found their way from
Brest to Milford without any mishap save the loss of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>255]</a></span>
their horses from lack of fresh water. The number
of troops carried by this fleet is variously estimated
at from about 3000 to 12,000 men. Madame De
Lussan, the French historian of the period, is very
definite so far as she goes, for without mentioning the
grand total she states that there were among them
800 men-at-arms, 600 crossbows, and 1200 foot-soldiers,
all picked troops. But then, again, the
French &ldquo;man-at-arms&rdquo; of the period included a
squire, a page, and three archers, so that the entire
French force probably numbered from 4000 to 5000
men. The command was nominally in the hands of
Jean de Rieux, Marshal of France, but the Sire de
Hugueville was the leading spirit, not only in the inception
but also in the conduct of the enterprise. He
had actually sold to the Church his large estate of
Agencourt near Montdidier, and devoted the proceeds
to the adventure which he had so much at
heart. There seems at any rate to have been no
stint of money in the undertaking, for it is particularly
noted what bravery of apparel and fine trappings
distinguished this French army when it
landed at Milford Haven. The fleet left Brest on
July 22nd and arrived early in August in excellent
condition, with the exception, as I have said, of the
horses, which had all been thrown overboard. Glyndwr
in the meantime had heard that the French were
on the sea, and, moving down into Pembrokeshire
with 10,000 men, he joined forces with them almost
immediately upon their landing.</p>

<p>There was no time to be lost and the united armies
turned first to Haverford-west, an Anglo-Flemish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>256]</a></span>
centre of some importance. The town was soon
taken and burnt, but the great Norman castle proved
altogether too hard a task even for so large a force.
So, falling back, Glyndwr and his French allies
marched to Tenby, laying waste the Flemish settlements,
though they had to look helplessly on while
an English fleet attacked the French ships and destroyed
fifteen of them. Thence under Glyndwr&rsquo;s
guidance the army moved on to Carmarthen, which
surrendered without much resistance. Glamorgan,
it will be remembered, had fallen away from its
allegiance to the Welsh cause, so Glyndwr took it on
his route towards England and gave the backsliders
of that unfortunate county some experience of his
relentless methods. Passing on thence through
Herefordshire in a fashion of which we know nothing
but may readily guess, the allied forces entered
Worcestershire and arrived within nine miles of the
capital of that county just as King Henry reached
it.</p>

<p>As early as the beginning of July, when the King
first heard of the intended French invasion, he had
issued proclamation to the sheriffs of several counties
to be in readiness with their forces, and it was
these that must now have been his chief support at
Worcester. On his way south he had issued another
summons to the forces of Herefordshire and the lower
counties to muster at the city of Hereford. It was
now about the middle of August, and without more
delay he marched his army out from Worcester to
meet the formidable combination that had penetrated
so far into his kingdom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>257]</a></span>
The spot where Glyndwr and Hugueville encamped
their forces was an old British fort on the
summit of Woodbury hill and is still known as
Owen&rsquo;s camp. Pennant visited it and made careful
notes and observations. It covers, he says,
about twenty-seven acres and is surrounded by
a single foss. The hill itself is lofty and of an oblong
form. One end is connected with the Abberly hills,
which, with this one of Woodbury, form a crescent,
the hollow between constituting an ideal arena for a
battle-ground.</p>

<p>When the King arrived he proceeded to take up
his position on the northern ridge, and the two armies
lay for eight days, both so admirably placed that each
feared to give advantage to the other by moving out
and risking so great a stake in the gage of battle.
Skirmishing, however, went on daily in the valley below.
The brave spirits of either army descended into
the arena and performed individual deeds of arms
between and in sight of both camps. &ldquo;They had
a fine slope,&rdquo; says Pennant, &ldquo;to run down, the
Welsh having a hollowed way as if formed especially
for the purpose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Some four or five hundred men in all fell during
this week of desultory skirmishing, including some
French knights of note. One might well have
looked, at this crisis, for some decisive and fierce
fight like that of Shrewsbury, which should live in
history. Never had Glyndwr penetrated so far into
Saxon territory; never before had ten thousand
Welshmen threatened Worcester as invaders; never
since England had become a united country had a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>258]</a></span>
hostile French army sat down in its very heart as
this one was now doing.</p>

<p>But the King at any rate showed his wisdom in
not venturing on a battle. He had ample provisions
behind him and was gathering strength. Glyndwr
and Hugueville, on the other hand, had wasted the
country on their route, and they were running short
of food. Yet even if Glyndwr had struck at once
and gained a victory, it is quite certain that with his
friends in the North already crushed he would not
have been able with what was left of his fifteen
thousand or so Welsh and French, to affect in any
way the fortunes of England by merely capturing
Worcester, and would have himself been in imminent
danger. Moreover, as the King clung to the
top of the hill and had perhaps nearly as many men
with him as the enemy, the risk attending an attack
would have been still greater. The Franco-Welsh
army, too, had a good deal of booty among them,
which to most of the individuals composing it was
probably a leading item for consideration.</p>

<p>When his enemies struck their camp and commenced
their backward march to Wales, the King
essayed to follow them, and found it no easy task in
a region already twice traversed by a hungry and
hostile army. He took some provisions with him,
but after eighteen waggon-loads of these had been
captured by Glyndwr&rsquo;s hungry soldiers he gave up
his barren attempts to harass their rapid march.
Hall&rsquo;s account of this campaign does not tally with
the account of the invaders, as is perhaps natural,
and he probably drew to some extent on his imagination
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>259]</a></span>
when he described Henry&rsquo;s pursuit in such
curiously quaint language:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;From hills to dales,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;from dales to
woodes, from woodes to marshes, and yet he could
never have them at an advantage. A worlde it was to
see his quotidian removings, his busy and painful wanderings,
his troublesome and uncertayne abiding, his
continual mocian, his daily peregrenacion in the desert
fells and craggy mountains of that barrenne infertile and
depopulate country.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But the Franco-Welsh army was soon deep in the
heart of Wales, and Henry, having given up the
pursuit in much more summary fashion than Hall
would have us believe in the face of dates, was concentrating
his forces at Hereford. Prince Henry
had already done something to harass the march of
the Welsh through Monmouth. Sir John Grendor
was negotiating with Owen&rsquo;s supporters in the valley
of the Usk. Sir John Berkrolles still held the great
castle of Coity with the utmost difficulty, and the
Bristol captains who had enabled Harlech to hold
out so long were now ordered down the Bristol
channel with supplies for the still beleaguered garrisons
of South Wales.</p>

<p>On September 10th Henry with a large force commenced
his fifth invasion of Wales. The reader,
wearied no doubt by the chronicle of these futile endeavours,
might now well look for some tangible
result, some crushing blow. There is nothing, however,
but the old, old story to tell. The King entered
Glamorgan and succeeded in relieving the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>260]</a></span>
single castle of Coity; he then turned tail, and the
Welsh at once, as in every case but one, when there
was no need for it, sprang upon his back. Besides
his spears and arrows Glyndwr once more
worked with his magic wand. The heavens descended
and the floods came and soaked and buffeted
the hapless monarch and his still more wretched and
ill-provisioned troops. Every river ran bank-high
and every brook was in flood; and the clumsy carts
that carried the commissariat were captured by
Glyndwr&rsquo;s men or whirled away in the rapids. The
old story of 1402 was repeated in the autumn of
1405. The royal army on their return had to cross
the valley of the Rhondda, where the national cause,
though more than once suppressed, was always vigorous
and responded to its famous war-cry, &ldquo;Cadwgan,
whet thy battle-axe.&rdquo; This valley runs from the westward
into the Taff at Pontypridd and is now astir with
the hum of grimy industry and bright with the flare
of forges. It was then a hive of fighting stock-farmers
fired with a great enthusiasm for Glyndwr.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;There was a certain Cadwgan,&rdquo; says the old Iolo
manuscript already quoted, &ldquo;who was a leader among
the men of the valley and a doughty henchman of
Glyndwr, and when it became necessary for him to call
the people to battle he used to march up and down the
valley whetting his axe. So when Owen came to Glyn
Rhondda he would say, &lsquo;Cadwgan, whet thy battle-axe,&rsquo;
and the moment he was heard to do so all living persons
collected about him in military array and from that day
to this the battle shout of Glyn Rhondda has been
&lsquo;Cadwgan, whet thy battle-axe.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>261]</a></span>
By October 1st the King was back at Worcester.
It would be of little profit to relate the various
orders he gave for resisting and pacifying the Welsh,
nor yet to give the names of the various Lord
Marchers whom he ordered to proceed upon expeditions
with small forces, where he himself had
failed with large ones. One is not surprised to
find that Owen and his French allies had Wales
for the most part to themselves and were unmolested
during the winter. The greater part of the French,
however, returned home again before Christmas,
some seventeen hundred remaining, for whom
Glyndwr found comfortable quarters. He seems to
have been greatly disappointed at the departure of
the others, as well as at the conduct of those who remained.
The alliance, indeed, proved unsatisfactory
to both parties. The French individually counted on
booty as their reward, whereas they found for the
most part a plundered and ravaged country. It is
possible, too, there may have been some racial friction
between the Welsh and their French allies. At any
rate the latter, as one of their old chroniclers remarks,
did not do much bragging when they got
home to Brittany, nor did those who remained in
Wales conduct themselves by any means to the satisfaction
of Glyndwr, but were altogether too much
given up to thoughts of plundering their friends.
Upon the whole their motives were too obvious and
the prospect of further assistance from them not
very cheering.</p>

<p>Western Pembroke in the meantime (Little England
beyond Wales), finding itself cut off from all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>262]</a></span>
assistance, in spite of the girdle of splendid castles by
which it was protected, began to find Glyndwr at
last too much for it. The earldom was in abeyance
and Sir Francis &Agrave;&rsquo;Court was governor of the county
and known as Lord of Pembroke. He called together
the representatives of the district, who
solemnly agreed to pay Glyndwr the sum of &pound;200
for a truce to last until the following May. So
Pembroke, having humbled itself and in so doing
having humbled England, which had thus failed it
in its hour of need, had peace. And Glyndwr, still
supreme, but not without some cause for depression,
returned to Harlech to take counsel with his friends
and prepare for a year that promised to be exceptionally
fruitful of good or ill.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX<br />
<br />
<span class="vsmlfont">THE TRIPARTITE INDENTURE<br />
1406</span></h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">D</span>URING the lull of this winter of 1405-6 messengers
were going backwards and forwards
between Harlech and Scotland.</p>

<p>The chief event of the early part of the new year
was the signing of that Tripartite Indenture which I
have already spoken of as being so often attributed
to the period before the battle of Shrewsbury.
Pity, for the sake of dramatic effect, that it was not,
and as Shakespeare painted it! Hotspur was then
alive and the power of the Percys at its height,
while Mortimer had not tarnished the splendour of
his house and dimmed such measure of reputation as
he himself enjoyed, by sinking his individuality in
that of his wife&rsquo;s strenuous father. Glyndwr alone
was greater than he had then been, though the zenith
of his fortunes had been reached and he was soon to
commence that long, hopeless struggle against fate
and overwhelming odds that has caused men to forget
the ravager in the fortitude of the hero.</p>

<p>Northumberland had outworn, as we have seen,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>264]</a></span>
the King&rsquo;s marvellous forbearance, and was now a
fugitive in Scotland with Bardolph, whose estates,
like his own, had been confiscated, and whose
person, like Northumberland&rsquo;s, was urgently wanted
by Henry. The old Earl had lost his nerve and had
taken alarm at certain indications on the part of the
Scots that they would not object to hand him over
to Henry in exchange for the doughty Lord Douglas
who had been held in honourable captivity since the
battle of Shrewsbury. Fearing this he and Bardolph
took ship from the western coast for France. But
either by prior agreement with Glyndwr or on their
own initiative they rounded the stormy capes of
Lleyn and, turning their ships&rsquo; prows shorewards,
landed in the sandy and sequestered cove of
Aberdaron.</p>

<p>Aberdaron is to this day the Ultima Thule of Wales.
It was then a remote spot indeed, though in times
long gone by, when pilgrims crept in thousands from
shrine to shrine along the coasts of Lleyn to the great
abbey, &ldquo;The Rome of the Welsh,&rdquo; on Bardsey
Island, it had been famous enough. It was not alone
its remoteness that recommended this lonely outpost,
flung out so far into the Irish Sea, to the two fugitives
and irrepressible conspirators. David Daron,
Dean of Bangor, a friend of Glyndwr, had been with
them in the North as one of his commissioners and
seems to have remained longer than his colleagues
with Percy. At any rate he was Lord of the Manor
of Aberdaron and had a house there to which he welcomed
his two English friends. The object of the
latter was not merely to fly to France but to stir up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>265]</a></span>
its King to renewed efforts against Henry. Glyndwr,
too, as we shall see, had been sending messengers to
France, and the impending meeting at Aberdaron
might be fruitful of great results.</p>

<p>It is an easy run by sea of twenty miles or so from
Harlech to the farther capes of Lleyn where the romantic
island of Bardsey, sanctified by the bones of its
twenty thousand saints, lifts its head to an imposing
height above the waves. To Aberdaron, just short of
the farthest point of the mainland, then came Glyndwr,
bringing with him Mortimer and no doubt
others of his court. It was on February 28, 1406,
that the meeting took place when the somewhat
notable <i>Indenture of Agreement</i> was signed by the
three contracting parties. The date of this proceeding
has been by no means undisputed, but of all
moments this particular one seems the most likely
and has the sanction of the most recent and exhaustive
historians of the period.</p>

<p>The bards had been prolific and reminiscent during
this quiet winter, and there seemed special call as
well as scope for their songs and forecasts. The
ancient prophecies of Merlin that were never allowed
to slumber, regarding the future of Britain and the
Welsh race, were now heard as loudly as they had
been before the battle of Shrewsbury, interpreted in
various ways in uncouth and strange metaphor.
Henry was the &ldquo;mouldwharp cursed of God&rsquo;s own
mouth.&rdquo; A dragon would come from the north and
with him a wolf from the west, whose tails would be
tied together. Fearful things would happen upon
the banks of the Thames and its channel would be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>266]</a></span>
choked with corpses. The rivers of England would
run with blood. The &ldquo;mouldwharp&rdquo; would then be
hunted out of the country by the dragon, the lion, and
the wolf, or, in other words, by Glyndwr, Percy, and
Mortimer. He would then be drowned and his kingdom
divided between his three triumphant foes.</p>

<p>Who framed the Indenture is not known; perhaps
Glyndwr himself, since he had been a barrister in
his youth and was certainly a ready penman. The
chronicler tells us that the contracting parties swore
fidelity to each other upon the gospels before putting
their names to the articles, and then proceeds to give
what purports to be the full text of the latter in Latin,
of which the following is a translation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;This year the Earl of Northumberland made a league
and covenant and friendship with Owyn Glyndwr and
Edmund Mortimer, son of the late Earl of March, in certain
articles of the form and tenor following: In the first
place that these Lords, Owyn, the Earl, and Edmund
shall henceforth be mutually joined, confederate, united
and bound by the bond of a true league and true friendship
and sure and good union. Again that every one of
these Lords shall will and pursue, and also procure, the
honour and welfare of one another; and shall in good
faith, hinder any losses and distresses which shall come
to his knowledge, by anyone whatsoever intended to be
inflicted on either of them. Every one also of them shall
act and do with another all and every of those things,
which ought to be done by good true and faithful friends
to good, true and faithful friends, laying aside all deceit
and fraud. Also, if ever any of the said Lords shall know
and learn of any loss or damage intended against another
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>267]</a></span>
by any persons whatsoever, he shall signify it to the others
as speedily as possible, and assist them in that particular,
that each may take such measures as may seem good
against such malicious purposes; and they shall be anxious
to prevent such injuries in good faith; also they shall
assist each other to the utmost of their power in the time
of necessity. Also if by God&rsquo;s appointment it should appear
to the said Lords in process of time that they are
the same persons of whom the Prophet speaks, between
whom the Government of the Greater Britain ought to be
divided and parted, then they and every one of them
shall labour to their utmost to bring this effectually to be
accomplished. Each of them, also, shall be content
with that portion of the kingdom aforesaid, limited as below,
without further exaction or superiority; yea, each
of them in such proportion assigned to him shall enjoy
liberty. Also between the same Lords it is unanimously
covenanted and agreed that the said Owyn and his heirs
shall have the whole of Cambria or Wales, by the borders,
limits and boundaries underwritten divided from
L&oelig;gira, which is commonly called England; namely
from the Severn Sea as the river Severn leads from the
sea, going down to the north gate of the city of Worcester;
and from that gate straight to the Ash tree, commonly
called in the Cambrian or Welsh language Owen
Margion, which grows on the highway from Bridgenorth
to Kynvar; thence by the highway direct, which is
usually called the old or ancient way, to the head or
source of the river Trent: thence to the head or source
of the river Mense; thence as that river leads to the sea,
going down within the borders, limits and boundaries
above written. And the aforesaid Earl of Northumberland
shall have for himself and his heirs the counties
below written, namely, Northumberland, Westmoreland,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>268]</a></span>
Lancashire, York, Lincoln, Nottingham, Derby, Stafford,
Leicester, Northampton, Warwick, and Norfolk. And
the Lord Edmund shall have all the rest of the whole of
England, entirely to him and his heirs. Also should any
battle, riot or discord fall out between two of the said
Lords (may it never be) then the third of the said Lords,
calling to himself good and faithful counsel, shall duly
rectify such discord, riot and battle; whose approval or
sentence the discordant parties shall be held bound to
obey. They shall also be faithful to defend the kingdom
against all men; saving the oak on the part of the
said Owyn given to the most illustrious Prince Charles by
the Grace of God King of the French, in the league and
covenant between them made. And that the same be,
all and singular, well and faithfully observed, the said
Lords Owyn, the Earl, and Edmund, by the holy body
of the Lord which they now steadfastly look upon and
by the holy gospels of God by them now bodily touched,
have sworn to observe the premises all and singular to
their utmost, inviolably; and have caused their seals to
be mutually affixed thereto.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Little, however, was to come of all this. Earl
Percy and Bardolph, after spending some two years
partly under Glyndwr&rsquo;s protection and partly in
France, found their way back to Scotland and in the
spring of 1408 played their last stake. Their fatuous
attempt with a small and ill-disciplined force of
countrymen to overturn Henry&rsquo;s throne was easily
defeated at Bramham Moor in Yorkshire by the
sheriff of that county, and their heads and limbs were
suspended from the gateways of various English
cities as a testimony to the dismal failure which the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>269]</a></span>
great house of Percy had made of its persistent
efforts to depose the King it had created.</p>

<p>Glyndwr for his part was neither now, nor yet to
be at any future time, in a position to help his
friends outside Wales. His power had passed its
zenith, though its decline is not marked by any
special incidents in this year 1406. Much the most
interesting event to be noted by the student of
his career and period, at this turning-point of his
fortunes, is a letter he wrote to the King of
France, almost immediately after his return from the
rendezvous with Northumberland and Bardolph.
His headquarters in the early spring of this year
seem to have been at Machynlleth, for the letter in
question was written from Pennal, a village about
four miles from this ancient outpost of Powys. Before
touching, however, on the main object of this memorable
communication, it will be well to recall the fact
that the remnants of the French invaders of the previous
year were just leaving Wales, to the great relief
of Owen. But his disappointment at the nature
of the help the French King had sent on this
occasion by no means discouraged him from looking
in the same direction for more effectual support.</p>

<p>It was now the period of the Papal Schism. For
nearly thirty years there had been two rival popes,
the one at Rome, the other at Avignon, and Catholic
Europe was divided into two camps, the countries
who adhered to the one spiritual chief professing to
regard the followers of the other as heretics unfit to
breathe the air of this world and without hope of pardon
in the next. The Christian Church was shaken
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>270]</a></span>
to its foundations and degenerated into an arena of
venomous strife. Nor was this only a war of words,
beliefs, interdicts, and sacerdotal fulminations, for
200,000 lives are said to have been lost over this
squabble for the vicarship of Christ. Pious men deplored
the lamentable state to which those who
should have been the upholders of religion had reduced
it. France, of course, in common with Spain,
maintained the cause of her own Pope. England held
to the Roman Pontiff, but even apart from the Lollard
element, which was now considerable, regarded
the wearisome dispute with a large measure of contemptuous
indifference. Scotland as a matter of
course took the opposite side to England. There was
no sentiment about &ldquo;the island&rdquo; among the Anglo-Normans
who lived north of the Tweed and who
had resisted successfully every attempt of their kinsmen
on the south of it to include them in their
scheme of government. They were all aliens alike
so far as those who had power were concerned, and
would not have understood, probably, that strange
sort of lingering loyalty to the soil that in spite of
everything still survived among the remnant of the
Britons. Glyndwr, of course, had acted directly
against this ancient theory, but mercenary soldiers
were now such a feature of military life that the importation
of these Frenchmen was perhaps of less
significance, more particularly as foreign troops were
continually serving in England in the pay of various
kings. Now, however, as a bait to the French King
and to quicken his interest in his cause, Glyndwr
offered to take Wales over to the allegiance of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>271]</a></span>
Avignon Pope. In this Pennal letter Owen dwells
at some length upon the details of the elections of the
rival popes which the French King himself had sent
over to him, and he excuses himself for following the
English lead in the past and adhering to the Roman
Pontiff on the score of not having hitherto been
properly informed regarding the rights and wrongs of
this same election. He recapitulates the promises
made to him by the King if he would acknowledge
Benedict XIII. and not his rival, Gregory XII.</p>

<p>After holding a council of the &ldquo;princes of his
race,&rdquo; prelates, and other clergy he had decided to
acknowledge the Avignon Pope. He begs the King of
France, as interested in the well-being of the Church
of Wales, to exert his influence with the Pope and
prevail upon him to grant certain favours which he
proceeds to enumerate:</p>

<p>In the first place, that all ecclesiastical censures
pronounced either by the late Clement or Benedict
against Wales or himself or his subjects should be
cancelled. Furthermore that they should be released
from the obligation of all oaths taken to the so-called
Urban and Boniface lately deceased and to their supporters.
That Benedict should ratify ordinations
and appointments to benefices and titles (<i>ordines
collatos titulos</i>) held or given by prelates, dispensations,
and official acts of notaries, &ldquo;involving
jeopardy of souls or hurt to us and our subjects from
the time of Gregory XI.&rdquo; Owen urges that Menevia
(St. Davids) should be restored to its original condition
as a Metropolitan church, which it held from
the time of that saint himself, its archbishop and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>272]</a></span>
confessor, and under twenty-four archbishops after
him, whose names, beginning with Clind and ending
with the significantly Anglo-Saxon patronymic
of Thompson, are herein set forth. Formerly, the
writer goes on to say, St. Davids had under it
the suffragan sees of Exeter, Bath, Hereford,
Worcester, Leicester (now transferred to Coventry),
Lichfield, St. Asaph, Bangor, Llandaff, and should
rightly have them still, but the Saxon barbarians
subordinated them to Canterbury. In language
that in later centuries was to be so often and so vainly
repeated, he represents that none but Welsh-speaking
clergy should be appointed, from the
metropolitan down to the curate. He requests
also that all grants of Welsh parish churches to
English monasteries or colleges should be annulled
and that the rightful patrons should be compelled to
present fit and proper persons to ordinaries, that
freedom should be granted to himself and his heirs
for their chapel, and all the privileges, immunities,
and exemptions which it enjoyed under their predecessors.
Curiously significant, too, and suggestive, is
the point he makes of liberty to found two universities,
one for North and one for South Wales.
Indeed this is justly regarded as one of many
bits of evidence that Owen was not merely a battle-field
hero, an avenging patriot, an enemy of tyrants,
but that he possessed the art of constructive statesmanship
had he been given the opportunity to prove
it. The educational zeal that does so much honour
to modern Wales is fond of pointing to Glyndwr as
the original mover in that matter of a Welsh national
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>273]</a></span>
university which has so recently been brought to a
successful issue. King Henry in this letter is naturally
an object of special invective, and Owen prays
that Benedict will sanction a crusade in the customary
form against the usurper Henry of Lancaster
for burning down churches and cathedrals, and for
beheading, hanging, and quartering Welsh clergy,
including mendicant friars, and for being a schismatic.
The writer would appear by this to have
unladen his conscience of the burden of the smoking
ruins of Bangor and St. Asaph and of many, it is to
be feared, less noteworthy edifices. Indeed, we find
him earlier in his career excusing himself for these
sacrilegious deeds and putting the onus of them on
the uncontrollable fury of his followers. But the verdict
of posterity has in no way been shaken by these
lame apologies. Finally he asks the French King
to make interest with Benedict for plenary forgiveness
for his sins and those of his heirs, his subjects,
and his men of whatsoever nation, provided they are
orthodox, for the whole duration of the war with
Henry of Lancaster.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

This letter, which covers many folio pages, has never been printed.
It is in indifferent Latin with the usual abbreviations. In the matter
of making and elucidating copies of it at the Record Office, Mr.
Hubert Hall gave me some valuable assistance, as also did Mr. C.&nbsp;M.
Bull. <a href="#FNanchor_14_14">Back</a></p>
</div>

<p>This document, a transcript of which is in the
Record Office, is preserved at Paris among the French
government archives and has attached to it by a
double string an imperfect yellow seal, bearing the
inscription, &ldquo;Owenus Dei Gratia princeps Walli&aelig;.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>274]</a></span>
It is dated the last day of March in the year of our
Lord 1406 and &ldquo;the sixth of our reign.&rdquo; The original
is endorsed with a note in Latin to the effect
that the above is the letter in which Owen, Prince
of Wales, acknowledged obedience to &ldquo;our Pope.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This year was not a stirring one in Wales. France,
to whom Owen was appealing, was in no condition,
or at any rate in no mood, to try a serious fall with
England. The policy of pin-pricks, to adapt a
modern term to the more strenuous form of annoyance
in practice in those times, had been pursued
with tolerable consistency since the first year of
Henry&rsquo;s reign, and the most Christian King had never
yet recognised his rival of England as a brother
monarch. Richard the Second&rsquo;s child-Queen and
widow, Isabel, had, after much haggling, been restored
by Henry to France, but that portion of her dower
which, according to her marriage settlement, should
have been returned with her, was unobtainable. She
was married to the Duke of Orleans&rsquo;s eldest son, aged
eleven, the greater portion of her dower being a lien
on Henry of England for the unpaid balance of the
sum above alluded to, an indifferent security. International
combats had been going merrily on in
the Channel and piratical descents upon either coast
were frequent. But this, of course, was not formal
war, though a French invasion of England had been
one of the chief nightmares of Henry&rsquo;s stormy
reign. Internal troubles in France, however, now
began somewhat to relax the strained nature of the
relationship with England, and Owen&rsquo;s chances of
Gallic help grew fainter. His son Griffith, or Griffin,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>275]</a></span>
was a prisoner in Henry&rsquo;s hands; he had been committed
to the Tower, and by an irony of fate was
under the special charge of one of that powerful
family to whom his father&rsquo;s old captive, Reginald
Grey of Ruthin, belonged. This gentleman, Lord
de Grey of Cedmore, so the Issue Rolls of the reign
inform us, was paid the sum of three and fourpence
a day for Griffin, son of Owen de Glendowdy, and
Owen ap Griffith ap Richard, committed to his custody.
Another companion in captivity for part of
the time, of this &ldquo;cub of the wolfe from the west,&rdquo;
strange to say, was the boy-king of Scotland, who,
like most monarchs of that factious and ill-governed
country, was probably happier even under such
depressing circumstances than if he were at large
in his own country, and his life most certainly was
much safer.</p>

<p>The Rolls during all these years show a constant
drain on the exchequer for provisions and money
and sinews of war for the beleaguered Welsh castles.
Here is a contract made with certain Bristol merchants,
mentioned by name, for sixty-six pipes of honey,
twelve casks of wine, four casks of sour wine, fifty
casks of wheat flour, and eighty quarters of salt to
be carried in diverse ships by sea for victualling and
providing &ldquo;the King&rsquo;s Kastles of Karnarvon,
Hardelagh, Lampadarn, and Cardigarn.&rdquo; Here again
are payments to certain &ldquo;Lords, archers and men-at-arms
to go to the rescue of Coity castle in Wales.&rdquo;
The rate of pay allowed to the soldiers of that day
for Welsh service is all entered in these old records
and may be studied by the curious in such matters.</p>

&pound;666.13.4.&rdquo; Again, in the same year: &ldquo;To Henry
Prince of Wales, for wages of 300 men-at-arms and 600
archers and canoniers and other artificers for the war
who lately besieged the castle of Hardelagh [Harlech].&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From the latter of these extracts, which are quoted
merely as types of innumerable entries of a like kind,
it will be seen that cannons were used, at any rate
in some of these sieges, and it is fairly safe to assume
that those used against Glyndwr were the first
that had been seen in Wales.</p>

<p>As the year 1406 advanced, the star of Owen
began most sensibly to wane. He was still, however,
keeping up the forms of regal state along the
shores of Cardigan Bay, and we find him formally
granting pardon to one of his subjects, John ap
Howel, at Llanfair near Harlech. The instrument is
signed &ldquo;per ipsum Princepem,&rdquo; and upon its seal is
a portrait of Owen bareheaded and bearded, seated
on a throne-like chair, holding a globe in his left hand
and a sceptre in his right. Among the witnesses to
the instrument are Griffith Yonge, Owen&rsquo;s Chancellor,
Meredith, his younger son, Rhys ap Tudor,
and one or two others. There is much that is hazy
and mysterious about the events of this year, but in
most parts of Wales one hears little or nothing of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>277]</a></span>
any shifting of the situation or any loosening of the
grip that Glyndwr&rsquo;s party had upon the country.
An armed neutrality of a kind probably existed between
the Royalists in those towns and castles that
had not fallen and the purely Celtic population in the
open country, which had long before 1406 been
purged of the hostile and the half-hearted of the
native race, and purged as we know by means of a
most trenchant and merciless kind.</p>

<p>Old Churchyard, who wrote these lines, lived at
any rate much nearer to Glyndwr&rsquo;s time than he did
to ours, and reflects, no doubt, the feeling of the
border counties and of no small number of Welshmen
themselves who were involved in that ruin from
which Wales did not recover for a hundred years.
In this year 1406, say the Iolo manuscripts, &ldquo;Wales
had been so impoverished that even the means of
barely sustaining life could not be obtained but by
rewards of the King,&rdquo; referring, doubtless, to the
Norman garrisons. &ldquo;Glamorgan,&rdquo; says the same
authority, &ldquo;turned Saxon again at this time though
two years later in 1408 they were excited to commotions
by the extreme oppressions of the King&rsquo;s
men,&rdquo; and when Owen returned once more to aid them,
their chiefs who had forsaken his cause burnt their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>278]</a></span>
barns and stack-yards, rather than that their former
leader and his people should find comfort from them.
They themselves then fled, the chronicler continues,
to England or the extremities of Wales, where in the
King&rsquo;s sea-washed castles they found refuge from
Owen&rsquo;s vengeance and were &ldquo;supported by the rewards
of treason and strategem.&rdquo;</p>

<p>More serious, however, than Glamorgan, bristling
as it was with Norman interests and Norman castles
and always hard to hold against them, the powerful
and populous island of Anglesey in the north and
the Vale of the Towy in the south fell away from
Glyndwr. Sheer weariness of the strife, coupled
perhaps with want of provisions, seems to have been
the cause. It was due certainly to no active
operations from the English border. Pardons upon
good terms were continually held out in the name of
Prince Henry and the King throughout the whole
struggle to any who would sue for them, always excepting
Owen and his chief lieutenants, though even
his son, as we have seen, was well treated in London.
Anglesey was threatened all the time by the great
castles of Conway, Carnarvon, and Beaumaris, which
held out steadily for the King. Though there was
no fighting in the island it is not unnatural that
Glyndwr&rsquo;s supporters from thence, being cut off from
their homes, which were liable to attacks by sea
even when the castles were impotent, were among
the first to give in. The strength of the following
which he gathered from beyond the Menai is significant
of the ardour of national enthusiasm in this
old centre of the Princes of Gwynedd, no less than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>279]</a></span>
2112 names of Anglesey men being submitted at
one time in this year for pardon. It is possible that
these backsliders did not all go home empty-handed,
but that a fair amount of plunder from the sack of
Marcher castles and the ravage of Marcher lands
found its way back with them. However that may
be, a royal commission was opened at Beaumaris on
November 10th of this year 1406 for the granting of
pardons and the assessment of fines to be paid therefor.
There is a list still extant in manuscript of the
whole two thousand-and-odd names. It will be
sufficient to notice, as a point not without interest,
that the six commotes of Anglesey paid &pound;537.7.0.
in fines upon this account. The goods of those slain
in battle were forfeited to the King, to be redeemed
at prices ranging from 2s. for a horse to 4d. for a
sheep. A few were outlawed, among whom was
David Daron, Dean of Bangor, at whose house the
Tripartite Convention was signed early in the year,
while Bifort, Bishop of Bangor, Owen&rsquo;s agent as he
might almost be called, together with the Earl of
Northumberland, was naturally excluded from purchasing
his pardon. Henceforward we hear little of
Anglesey in connection with Owen, though the remaining
years of his resistance are so misty in their
record of him that it would be futile to attempt
a guess at the part its people may or may not have
played in the long period of his decline.</p>

<p>The defection of Ystrad Towy, the heart and life
of the old South Welsh monarchy and always a great
source of strength to Owen, must have been still
more disheartening, but it seems likely that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>280]</a></span>
submission of his allies between Carmarthen, Dynevor,
and Llandovery was of a temporary nature.
Mysterious but undoubtedly well-founded traditions,
too, have come down concerning the movements of
Glyndwr himself during the latter part of this year.
He is pictured to us as wandering about the country,
sometimes with a few trusty followers, sometimes
alone and in disguise. This brief and temporary
withdrawal from publicity does not admit of any confusion
with the somewhat similar circumstances in
which he passed the closing years of his life. All old
writers are agreed as to this hiatus in the midst of
Glyndwr&rsquo;s career, even when they differ in the precise
date and in the extent of his depression. One
speaks of him as a hunted outlaw, which for either the
year 1405 or 1406 is of course ridiculous. Another,
with much more probability, represents him as going
about the country in disguise with a view to discovering
the inner sentiments of the people. A cave is
shown near the mouth of the Dysanni between
Towyn and Llwyngwril, where during this period he
is supposed to have been concealed for a time from
pursuing enemies by a friendly native. Upon the
mighty breast of Moel Hebog, over against Snowdon,
another hiding-place is connected with his name and
with the same crisis in his fortunes. A quite recently
published manuscript<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> from the Mostyn collection
contains a story to the effect that when the abbot of
Valle Crucis, near Llangollen, was walking on the
Berwyns early one morning he came across Glyndwr
wandering alone and in desultory fashion. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>281]</a></span>
abbot, as head of a Cistercian foundation, was presumably
unfriendly to the chieftain whose iconoclasms
must have horrified even his friends the
Franciscans. There is nothing of interest in the
actual details of this chance interview. The fact
of Glyndwr being alone in such a place is suggestive
and welcome merely as a little bit of evidence
recently contributed to the strong tradition of
his long wanderings. The abbot appears from the
narrative to have been anything but glad to see him
and told him that he had arisen a hundred years too
soon, to which the Welsh leader and Prince made no
reply but &ldquo;turned on his heel and departed in
silence.&rdquo;</p>

</div>

<p>A much fuller and better-known story, however, of
this mysterious period of Glyndwr&rsquo;s career survives
in the Iolo manuscripts. Sir Laurence Berkrolles of
St. Athan was a famous scion of that Anglo-Norman
stock who had carved up Glamorganshire in Henry
the First&rsquo;s time. He had inherited the great castle
and lordship of Coity from his mother&rsquo;s family, the
Turbervilles, whose male line had only just failed after
three centuries of such occupation as must have made
men of them indeed. Sir Laurence, it need hardly
be remarked, had experienced a stormy time for
the past few years, battling for his patrimony
with Glyndwr&rsquo;s sleepless legions. There was now
a lull, presumably in this year 1406, and Sir Laurence
was resting in his castle and rejoicing doubtless
in the new sense of security to which Glamorgan had
just settled down. Hither one day came a strange
gentleman, unarmed and accompanied by a servant,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>282]</a></span>
and requested in French a night&rsquo;s lodging of Sir Laurence.
The hospitable Marcher readily assented and
placed the best that the castle afforded before his
guest, to whom he took so great a fancy that he ended
in begging him to prolong his stay for a few days.
As an inducement he informed the traveller that it
was quite possible he might in such case be fortunate
enough to see the great Owen Glyndwr, for it was
rumoured that he was in that neighbourhood, and he
(Sir Laurence) had despatched his tenants and servants
and other men in his confidence to hunt for
Owen and bring him in, alive or dead, under
promise of great reward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would be very well,&rdquo; replied the guest, &ldquo;to
secure that man were any persons able to do so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Having remained at Sir Laurence&rsquo;s castle four days
and three nights the stranger announced his intention
of departing. On doing so he held out his hand to
his host and thus addressed him:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Owen Glyndwr, as a sincere friend, having neither
hatred, treachery, or deception in his heart, gives his
hand to Sir Laurence Berkrolles and thanks him for
his kindness and generous reception which he and his
friend (in the guise of a servant) have experienced
from him at his castle, and desires to assure him on
oath, hand in hand, and hand on heart, that it will
never enter his mind to avenge the intentions of Sir
Laurence towards him, and that he will not, so far as
he may, allow such desire to exist in his own knowledge
and memory, nor in the minds of any of his
relations or adherents.&rdquo; Having spoken thus and with
such astonishing coolness disclosed his identity,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>283]</a></span>
Glyndwr and his pseudo-servant went their way.
Sir Laurence was struck dumb with amazement, and
that not merely in a metaphorical but in a literal
sense, for the story goes on to say that he lost the
power of speech from that moment! Glyndwr&rsquo;s
faithful laureate, Iolo Goch, strengthens the tradition
of his master&rsquo;s mysterious disappearance at this time
by impassioned verses deploring his absence and calling
on him to return to his heartbroken poet:</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X<br />
<br />
<span class="vsmlfont">ABERYSTWITH. OWEN&rsquo;S POWER DECLINES<br />
1407-1408</span></h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">L</span>ITTLE is known of Owen&rsquo;s movements during
the first half of the year 1407. Entries here
and there upon the Rolls indicate that no improvement
so far as the general peace of Wales was
concerned had taken place, whatever there may
have been in Henry&rsquo;s prospects of ultimately recovering
his authority there, prospects which now wore
a much brighter look. For though Glyndwr and his
captains were still active in the field, there nevertheless
runs through all the scant scraps of news we now
get of him an unmistakable note of depression on
the part of his friends, with proportionate confidence
on that of his enemies. Prince Henry was still
Lieutenant of the Marches of South Wales, in addition
to his hereditary jurisdiction, such as it now
was, over the royal counties. A great effort was in
contemplation, in view of Owen&rsquo;s failing strength, to
put a complete end to the war. Pardons were freely
offered to his supporters, and even urged, upon the
most lenient terms, and the Marcher Barons, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>285]</a></span>
were inclined at times, when not personally in danger,
to forget the conditions on which they held
their lands, were sternly forbidden to leave their
castles. Things had not been going well in France;
Calais had been hard pressed and the great English
possessions in the South had been lamentably reduced
in extent. Edward the Third is computed to
have reigned over six million subjects to the north
of the Pyrenees, a population much greater than
that of England and Wales combined. Henry had
but a fraction left of this kingdom, and that fraction
most unsteady in its devotion. He had been several
times on the very point of making a personal
attempt to repair his failing fortunes beyond the
Channel. But his health was beginning even thus
early to fail, and his nerves were completely unstrung.
He had made up his mind, however, to lead
one more expedition against Owen, now that the
chances seemed so much more favourable than
on former occasions. From even this, however, it
will be seen that he ultimately flinched, and it was
perhaps well that he did so. His son and the captains
round him understood Welsh warfare much
better than Henry. The rush of great armies
through Wales had failed hopelessly as a means of
coercing it, and would fail again. The steady pressure
of armed bands upon Owen&rsquo;s front and flanks,
and liberal terms to all who deserted him, were the
only methods of wearing out the resources of this
stubborn patriot, and they were already succeeding.
That he was himself pressing hard upon Pembrokeshire,
however, just at this time is evident from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>286]</a></span>
orders which were issued for forwarding arms and
provisions for the defence of the royal castles in that
county, the recipient being Sir Francis &Agrave;&rsquo;Court, the
King&rsquo;s constable there. Aberystwith castle, however,
was to be the chief point of the Prince&rsquo;s attack
this autumn, and his father, as I have said, was expected
to take part in an expedition that came to be
associated with much &eacute;clat.</p>

<p>An impression not altogether easy to account for,
that the fall of this great castle would prove the final
blow to Owen&rsquo;s resistance, got abroad, and there was
a great rush of knights and nobles to take part in
the ceremony. A picked force of 2400 archers
and men-at-arms was told off for the service, and an
entry in the Issue Rolls notes the sum of &pound;6825 as
being set aside for their pay over the period of six
months beginning in June. This was a strong
nucleus for an expedition that could be supplemented
by the levies of the border counties and
the spare strength of the local Marcher barons.
Aberystwith Castle occupies a site of much distinction,
placed upon a bold promontory projecting into
the sea. Its ruins still survive as one of the innumerable
witnesses to Cromwell&rsquo;s superfluous vandalism,
and afford a favourite lounge to summer visitors at
the popular Welsh watering-place. But the first
castle built on Norman lines was erected in the
twelfth century by Gilbert de Strongbow, the earliest
Norman adventurer in this district. A centre for
generations of Norman-Welsh strife, dismantled and
restored again and again by contentious chieftains,
it was finally rebuilt by Edward I.; and what Cromwell
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>287]</a></span>
and time&rsquo;s destroying hand have left of it dates
chiefly from that luminous epoch in Welsh history.
Not many of those, perhaps, who loiter amidst its lifeless
fragments are aware that in the season of 1407
it was the object of quite a fashionable crusade on
the part of the chivalry of England, well supplied
with every requisite of siege warfare that the primitive
science of the period could provide.</p>

<p>Harlech was at this time the headquarters of
Glyndwr&rsquo;s family, including Edmund Mortimer, but
to localise Glyndwr himself becomes now more difficult
than ever. Since Carmarthen and most of
South Wales had forsaken their allegiance, his energies
must have been still more severely taxed in
keeping up the spirit and directing the movements
of his widely scattered bands. We heard of him
lately raiding through Pembroke and threatening
the Flemish settlements. Merioneth and Carnarvon
in the North were still faithful, and we can well believe
that the great castles of Aberystwith and Harlech,
lying midway between the remnant of his southern
followers and those of the North, were in some
sort the keys to the situation. Aberystwith, in
which Glyndwr had placed a strong garrison under
a trusty captain, seemed so, at any rate, to the English.
Great guns were sent all the way from Yorkshire
to Bristol, to be forwarded thence by sea to the
coast of Cardigan, while ample stores of bows and
arrows, bowstrings, arblasts, stone-shot, sulphur, and
saltpetre were ordered to be held in readiness at
Hereford. Woods upon the banks of the Severn
were to be cut down and the forest of Dean to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>288]</a></span>
picked over for trees, out of which was to be contrived
the siege machinery for the subjugation of
hapless Aberystwith. A troop of carpenters were to
sail from Bristol for the devoted spot and erect scaffolds
and wooden towers upon a scale such as had
not been before witnessed at any of the innumerable
sieges of this Welsh war. Proclamations calling out
the great nobility of western England and the
Marches to meet the King and Prince at Hereford
were sent out. Owen, as well as Aberystwith and
Harlech, was to be crushed, and the King himself,
with the flower of his chivalry, was to be there to
witness the closing scene. How far off even yet was
the final extinction of Owen, no one then could have
well imagined.</p>

<p>But a temporary check came to these great preparations.
The King, as he had shrunk from crossing
the Channel, now shrank from crossing the Welsh
border. A pestilence, somewhat more severe than
those which were almost chronic in the country in
those days, swept over the island and was more
virulent in the West than elsewhere. It may have
been this that for a time suspended operations.
Strange to say, too, the Richard myth was not quite
extinct, for during this summer bills were found
posted up about London proclaiming that he was
&ldquo;yet alive and in health, and would come again
shortly with great magnificence and power to recover
his kingdom.&rdquo; But neither pestilence nor the
vagaries of the King nor false rumours of the dead
Richard were allowed to permanently unsettle the
Aberystwith enterprise. Fighting in Wales had by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>289]</a></span>
no means been a popular or fashionable pastime,
when there was no territory to be won or to be defended.
It was poor sport for the heavy-armed sons
of Mars of that period, all athirst for glory, this tilting
over rough ground at active spearmen who melted
away before their cumbrous onslaught only to return
and deal out death and wounds at some unexpected
moment or in some awkward spot. But now whole
clouds of gay cavaliers, besides men scarred and
weather-beaten with Welsh warfare, gathered to the
crusade against Aberystwith. French wars just
now were at a discount, not because the spirit was
unwilling, but because the exchequer was weak,
so, the supply of fighting knights and squires being
for the moment greater than the demand, Prince
Henry reaped the benefit of the situation in his
march through South Wales.</p>

<p>But the bluest blood and the most brilliant equipment
were futile in attack against castles that nature
and Edward the First had combined to make invulnerable.
The guns and scaffolds and wooden towers
were all there but they were powerless against
Aberystwith and the brave Welshmen who, under
Owen&rsquo;s lieutenant, Rhys ap Griffith ap Llewelyn,
defended it. The King&rsquo;s particular cannon, weighing
four and one half tons, was there, which, with
another called the Messenger, shook the rock-bound
coasts, striking terror, we may well fancy, into the
peasants of that remote country and proving more
destructive to those behind it than those before, for
we are told that it burst during the siege, a common
thing with cannons of that day, dealing death to all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>290]</a></span>
around. Once an hour, it is usually estimated, was
the greatest rapidity with which these cumbrous
pieces could be fired with safety, and we may well
believe that the moment of explosion must have
been a much more anxious one, seeing how often
they burst, to their friends beside them than to their
foes hidden behind the massive walls of a Norman
castle. The Duke of York was there, and the Earl
of Warwick, who, two years previously, had defeated
Glyndwr in a pitched battle and was eager, no doubt,
to meet him again. Sir John Grendor, too, was
present, no courtier, but a hero of the Welsh wars,
and Sir John Oldcastle, a typical border soldier, who
became Lord Cobham and was ultimately hunted
down as a Lollard at Welshpool and burned by
Henry V.; while Lord Berkeley commanded the
fleet and managed the siege train. It was not
known at Aberystwith, either by the Welsh or the
besiegers, where Owen was. He could not readily
trust himself in castles, besieged both by land and
sea, and run the risk of being caught like a fox in a
trap. He bided his time, on this occasion, as will be
seen, and arrived precisely at the right moment.
Prince Henry found the castle impregnable to assault,
and there was nothing for it but to sit down
and reduce it by starvation. The only hope of the
garrison lay in Owen&rsquo;s relieving them, and with such
an army before them the possibility of this seemed
more than doubtful. Provisions soon began to fail,
and in the middle of September Rhys ap Griffith
made overtures and invited seventeen of the English
leaders within the castle to arrange a compromise.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>291]</a></span>
One of these was Richard Courtney of the Powderham
family, a scholar of Exeter College, Oxford,
and Chancellor of the University. Mass was said
by this accomplished person to the assembled Welsh
and English leaders, after which they received the
sacrament and then proceeded to draw up an agreement
which seems a strange one. By it the Welsh
undertook to deliver up the castle on November 1st
if Glyndwr had not in the meantime appeared and
driven off the besiegers. Till that date an armistice
was to continue. Those of the garrison who would
not accept these terms were to be turned out to take
their chance; the rest were to receive a full pardon
at the capitulation. The abbot of Ystradfflur, who,
though a Cistercian, had taken Owen&rsquo;s side, and
three Welsh gentlemen, were given up as hostages.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<p class="caption">ABERYSTWITH CASTLE.</p>
</div>

<p>The Prince and his nobles were doubtless glad
enough to get away from so monotonous a task in so
remote a spot, though their return to England was
hardly a glorious one. No one seems to have expected
Owen, and only five hundred soldiers were
left in camp at the abbey of Ystradfflur, some fifteen
miles off, to insure the proper fulfilment of the
agreement when November should come round.
Parliament was to meet and did meet at Gloucester
in October, and the King himself, so much importance
did he attach to Aberystwith, still talked of returning
with his son to receive its surrender at the
appointed time. But neither the royal progress
nor the surrender became matters of fact, for during
October Owen slipped unexpectedly into the castle
with a fresh force, repudiated, as indeed he had a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>292]</a></span>
right to repudiate, the agreement, and branded as
traitors to his cause those who had made it, which
was hard. The five hundred royal soldiers at
Ystradfflur had shrunk in numbers and relaxed in
discipline, and had at any rate no mind to encounter
Owen, who remained in possession of the west coast
and its castles throughout a winter which so far as
any further news of him is concerned was an uneventful
one. In the meantime the Parliament
which sat at Gloucester for six weeks in the autumn
was greatly exercised about Welsh affairs. Wales
had returned no revenue since Glyndwr first raised
his standard, and the sums of money that had been
spent in vain endeavours to crush his power had been
immense. The feeling was now stronger than ever
that taxation for this purpose, one that brought no
returns either in glory or plunder, had reached its
limit, and that it was high time the nobles whose interests
lay in Wales should take upon themselves
for the future the heavy burden of Welsh affairs.</p>

<p>One incident occurred at this Parliament which
had some significance and was not without humour.
The Prince of Wales was publicly thanked for his
services before Aberystwith almost upon the very
day when, unknown, of course, to him and to those
at distant Gloucester, Owen had slipped into the castle
about which so much stir was being made, upset
the whole arrangement, and turned the costly campaign
into an ignominious failure. It is significant,
too, that the Prince, after acknowledging the praises
of his father and the Parliament, kneeled before the
former and &ldquo;spake some generous words&rdquo; concerning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>293]</a></span>
the Duke of York, whose advice and assistance
&ldquo;had rescued the whole expedition from peril and
desolation.&rdquo; This looks as if Owen&rsquo;s people had not
allowed the return journey of the Prince and his
friends and his even still large force to be the promenade
that was expected. It may well indeed have
been the ubiquitous Glyndwr himself from whom
the sagacity of the Duke delivered them in the
wilds of Radnor or Carmarthen. Though Aberystwith
and Harlech were safe for this winter, the
Prince, with a deliberation perhaps emphasised by
chagrin at his failure, made arrangements for a second
attempt to be undertaken in the following
summer.</p>

<p>The winter of 1407-1408 was the most terrible
within living memory. It is small wonder that no
echo of siege or battle or feat of arms breaks the silence
of the snow-clad and war-torn country. Birds
and animals perished by thousands, for a sheet of
frozen snow lay upon the land from before Christmas
till near the end of March. Yet outside Wales even
so cruel a winter could not still all action. For
Glyndwr&rsquo;s old ally, Northumberland, selected this,
of all times and seasons, for that last reckless bid for
power which has been before alluded to, and with
Bardolph and Bifort, Owen&rsquo;s Bishop of Bangor, went
out across the bitter cold of the Yorkshire moors, the
first two of them, at any rate, to death and ruin.
Bifort, however, seems to have got away and carried
the nominal honours of his bishopric for many
years.</p>

<p>The opening of summer in 1408 found Owen still
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>294]</a></span>
active and dangerous. No longer so as of old to the
peace of England and to Henry&rsquo;s throne,&mdash;that crisis
had passed away,&mdash;but he was still an unsurmountable
obstacle to the good government of Wales. We
know this rather from the anxiety to subdue him
manifested this year by the King&rsquo;s council to the
exclusion of all other business, than from any detailed
knowledge of his actions. Of these one can
guess the general tenor, and the necessary sameness
of a guerilla warfare somewhat mitigates the disappointment
natural at the lack of actual detail. One
gathers from the brief but, from one point of view,
significant entries in the public records how entirely
demoralised most of the country still remained.
Here is an order to prevent supplies being sent to
the rebels; there a caution to keep the bonfires in
Cheshire or Shropshire ready for the match; there
again are notes of persons becoming surety for the
good behaviour of repentant Welshmen, or Lord
Marchers trying to come again to terms with their
rebellious Cymric tenants. Panic-stricken letters,
however, came no more from beleaguered castles,
nor do the people of Northampton any longer quake
in their beds at the name of Glyndwr, though the
border counties, and with good cause, feel as yet by
no means wholly comfortable.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;In 1408,&rdquo; says the Iolo manuscript, &ldquo;the men of
Glamorgan were excited to commotion by the extra oppression
of the King&rsquo;s men; many of the chieftains who
had obtained royal favour burnt their stacks and barns
lest Owen&rsquo;s men should take them. But these chieftains
fled to the extremity of England and Wales, where they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>295]</a></span>
were defended in the castles and camps of the King&rsquo;s
forces and supported by the rewards of treason and
stratagem. Owen could not recover his lands and authority
because of the treachery prevalent in Anglesey
and Arvon, which the men of Glamorgan called the
treason of the men of Arvon.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All this is sadly involved, but one treasures anything
that has a genuine ring about it in connection
with this shadowy year. Arvon, it may be remarked,
is the &ldquo;cantref&rdquo; facing the submissive Anglesey,
and no doubt the royal castle of Carnarvon was able
by this time to exercise an intimidating influence on
that portion of the country.</p>

<p>Prince Henry&rsquo;s commission as Lieutenant of both
North and South Wales was again renewed; and,
gathering his forces at Hereford in June, he again
moved on towards the stubborn castle of Aberystwith,
making Carmarthen, the old capital of South
Wales, his base of operations. Aberystwith this
time held out till winter, when it at last fell, the garrison
meeting with no harsher treatment than that
of ejection without arms or food. Harlech, which
Gilbert and John Talbot had by the throat, with a
thousand well-armed men and a big siege train, resisted
even longer. The Welsh this time were able
to utilise the sea, which in those days beat against
the foot of the high rock upon which the castle
stands, a rock now removed from the shore by half
a mile or more of sandy common. Glyndwr, too,
was now able to move freely from one beleaguered
fortress to another. Both of them held out with
singular valour and tenacity, attacking the provision
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>296]</a></span>
boats which came from Bristol for the besieging
armies, and disputing every point that offered an opportunity
with sleepless vigilance and tireless energy.
Edmund Mortimer died either during the siege or
immediately after the surrender, of starvation some
writers say, though privation would perhaps be a
more appropriate and likely term. Mortimer&rsquo;s wife
and three girls, with a son Lionel, together with
that &ldquo;eminent woman of a knightly family,&rdquo; Glyndwr&rsquo;s
own consort, fell into the King&rsquo;s hands with
the capture of Harlech, and seem to have been taken
to London in a body.</p>

<p>There is something pathetic about this wholesale
termination of Owen&rsquo;s domestic life, in what for that
period would be called his old age. One longs, too, to
know something about it. How Margaret Hanmer
deported herself under the reflected glories of her
lord. Whether indeed she saw much of him, and if
so, where; whether she was a stout-hearted patriot
and bore the trials and the uncertainties of her
dangerous pre-eminence with proud fortitude, or
whether she wept over the placid memories of
Sycherth and Glyndyfrdwy, and deplored the fortune
that had made her a hero&rsquo;s wife and a wanderer.
She had three married daughters to give her shelter
in Herefordshire. Let us hope that she found her
way to one of them, as her husband did years later
when the storms of his life were over. As for the
Mortimers, that branch of the family was entirely
wiped out. The children died, and the gentle
Katherine, who had married so near the throne of
England, soon followed them and lies somewhere
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>297]</a></span>
beneath the roar of London traffic in a city churchyard.
One account places the capture and removal
to London of Glyndwr&rsquo;s family at a later period, but
as the interest in this is chiefly a matter of sentiment,
the precise date is of no special moment.</p>

<p>The lines were now rapidly tightening round
Owen. The English government, by this time
fairly free from foreign complications, showed a
vigilance in Wales which it would have been well
for it to have shown in former years, when the
danger was much greater. Owen, on his part, relapsed
gradually into a mere guerilla leader, though
the hardy bands that still rallied round him and
scorned to ask for pardon were still so numerous
and formidable that it was with difficulty the King
could prevent some of the Marcher barons even now
from purchasing security against his attacks. Talbot
with bodies of royal troops still remained as a garrison
in Wales. It is curiously significant, too, and
not readily explicable, that in this year 1409 the
town of Shrewsbury closed her gates against an
English army marching into Wales and refused them
provisions. It looks as if even the honest Salopians,
tired of keeping guard against the ubiquitous
Glyndwr, had thus late, and for the second time in
the war, made some sort of terms with him. We find
also Charleton, Lord of Powys, about this time granting
pardons to those of his tenants who had been
&ldquo;out with Glyndwr,&rdquo; while he was rewarding his
more faithful lieges in the borough of Welshpool
by an extension of their corporation limits to an
area of twenty thousand acres, an unique distinction
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>298]</a></span>
which that interesting border town enjoys to this
day.</p>

<p>Meanwhile it must not be supposed that the royal
party treated all Welsh captives with the leniency
we have seen at Aberystwith, Harlech, and elsewhere.
Rhys Ddu, a noted captain of Glyndwr&rsquo;s,
and Philip Scudamore, a scion of that famous Herefordshire
family into which the Welsh leader&rsquo;s
daughter had married, were taken prisoners while
raiding in Shropshire and sent to London and placed
in the Tower, where several Welsh nobles had been
this long time languishing. Rhys was taken to the
Surrey side of the river by the Earl of Arundel,
tried, and handed over to the sheriff, who had him
dragged upon a hurdle to Tyburn and there executed.
His quarters, like those of many Welsh patriots before
him, were sent to hang over the gates of four
English cities, and his head was affixed to London
Bridge. Ten Welsh gentlemen were under lock and
key at Windsor Castle. They were now handed
over to the Marshal and kept in the Tower till
heavy ransoms were forthcoming. But Henry&rsquo;s
treatment of his Welsh enemies was upon the whole
the reverse of vengeful, and he was wise in his generation.
His wholesale pardons to men wearied
with years of war in a cause now so utterly hopeless
were infinitely more efficacious against that implacable
foe who would not himself dream of asking
terms. Owen, too, on his part had many prisoners,
hidden away in mountain fastnesses, chief of whom
was the hapless David Gam, whom my readers will
almost have forgotten. Nine of these, we are told
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>299]</a></span>
by one writer, his followers hung, greatly to their
leader&rsquo;s chagrin, since he wanted them for hostages
or for exchange.</p>

<p>The Avignon Pope had done Owen little good.
A certain religious flavour was introduced into the
martial songs of the bards, and Owen&rsquo;s native claims
to the leadership of Wales were now supplemented
by papal and ecclesiastical blessings from this new
and very modern fount of inspiration. But everything
ecclesiastical at Bangor was in ashes, the torch,
it will be remembered, having been applied by
Glyndwr himself. The royal bishop, Young, had
years before fled to England and was now enjoying
the peaceful retirement of Rochester. Owen&rsquo;s
bishop, Bifort, as we have seen, was a wandering
soldier. The more vigorous Trevor, who came back
to Owen in 1404, was at this time in France, making
a last effort, it is supposed, to interest the French
King in Glyndwr&rsquo;s waning cause. But death overtook
him while still in Paris, and he lies buried in
the chapel of the infirmary of the Abbey de St.
Victor beneath the following epitaph:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Hic jacet Reverendus in Christo Pater Johannes
Episcopus asaphensis in Wallia qui obiit A.D. 1410 die
secundo mensis aprilis cujus anima feliciter requiescat in
pace. Amen.&rdquo;</p>

<br />
<span class="vsmlfont">LAST YEARS OF OWEN&rsquo;S LIFE<br />
1410-1416</span></h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>F the last six years of Owen&rsquo;s life, those from
1410 to 1416, there is little to be said. His
cause was hopelessly lost and he had quite
ceased to be dangerous. Wales was reconquered
and lay sick, bleeding, and wasted beneath the calm
of returning peace. Thousands, it is to be feared,
cursed Glyndwr as they looked upon the havoc
which the last decade had wrought. The unsuccessful
rebel or patriot, call him what you will, has far
more friends among those yet unborn than among
his own contemporaries, above all in the actual
hour of his failure. Of this failure, too, the Welsh
were reminded daily, not only by their wasted
country and ruined homesteads but by fierce laws
enacted against their race and a renewal on both
sides of that hatred which the previous hundred
years of peace had greatly softened.</p>

<p class="caption">MONNINGTON COURT AND CHURCH.</p>
</div>

<p>Men born of Welsh parents on both sides were
now forbidden to purchase land near any of the
Marcher towns. They were not permitted to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>301]</a></span>
citizens of any borough, nor yet to hold any office,
nor carry armour nor any weapon. No Welshman
could bind his child to a trade, nor bring him up to
letters, while English men who married Welsh women
were disfranchised of their liberties. In all suits
between Englishmen and Welshmen the judge and
jury were to be of the former race, while all
&ldquo;Cymmorthau,&rdquo; or gatherings for mutual assistance
in harvest or domestic operations, were strictly
forbidden.</p>

<p>These laws were kept on the statute books till the
real union of Wales and England in Henry the
Eighth&rsquo;s time, but gradually became a dead letter as
the memory of the first ten bloody years of the century
grew fainter. Glyndwr, however, believed in
the justice of his cause, and if he expressed remorse
for the methods which he had used to uphold it, we
hear nothing of such apologies. That he showed
the courage of his convictions in heroic fashion no
one can gainsay. That men could be found to stand
even yet in such numbers by his side is the most eloquent
tribute that could be paid to his personal
magnetism. He had lost all his castles, unless indeed,
as seems likely, those grim towers of Dolbadarn
and Dolwyddelan in the Snowdon mountains
were left to him. He became henceforward a mere
outlaw, confined entirely to the mountains of Carnarvon
and Merioneth, between those fierce and
rapid raids which we dimly hear of him still making
upon the Northern Marches. His old companions,
Rhys and William ap Tudor, who had been with him
from the beginning, were in the King&rsquo;s hands, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>302]</a></span>
were about this time executed at Chester with the
usual barbarities of the period. The elder was the
grandfather of Owen Tudor, and consequently the ancestor
of our present King. David Gam was still a
prisoner in Owen&rsquo;s hands till 1412, when the King
entered into negotiations for his release through the
agency of Llewelyn ap Howel, Sir John Tiptoft, and
William Boteler. What terms were made we know
not; an exchange was in all likelihood effected, seeing
how many of Owen&rsquo;s friends were in captivity.
David&rsquo;s liberation, however, was by some means successfully
accomplished, and he lived to fight and
fall by the King&rsquo;s side at Agincourt, being knighted,
some say, as he lay dying upon that memorable field.</p>

<p>When, in 1413, Prince Henry came to the throne,
he issued a pardon to all Welsh rebels indiscriminately,
not excepting Glyndwr. But, obstinate to
the last, the old hero held to his mountains, refusing
to ask or to receive a favour, striking with his now
feeble arm, whenever chance offered, the English
power or those who supported it. When Henry IV.
succumbed to those fleshly ills which constant trouble
had brought upon his once powerful frame, Glyndwr
was still in the field and royal troops still stationed
in the Welsh mountains to check his raids. Tradition
has it that he was at last left absolutely alone,
when he is supposed to have wandered about the
country in disguise and in a fashion so mysterious
that a wealth of legend has gathered around these
wanderings.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;In 1415,&rdquo; says one old chronicler, &ldquo;Owen disappeared
so that neither sight nor tidings of him could be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>303]</a></span>
obtained in the country. It was rumoured that he escaped
in the guise of a reaper bearing a sickle, according
to the tidings of the last who saw and knew him, after
which little or no information transpired respecting him
nor of the place or name of his concealment. The prevalent
opinion was that he died in a wood in Glamorgan;
but occult chroniclers assert that he and his men still
live and are asleep on their arms in a cave called Ogof
Dinas in the Vale of Gwent, where they will continue
until England is self-abased, when they will sally forth,
and, recognising their country&rsquo;s privileges, will fight for
the Welsh, who shall be dispossessed of them no more
until the Day of Judgment, when the earth shall be consumed
with fire and so reconstructed that neither oppression
nor devastation shall take place any more, and
blessed will he be who will see that time.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Carte says that Owen wandered down to Herefordshire
in the disguise of a shepherd and found refuge
in his daughter&rsquo;s house at Monnington.</p>

<p>It is quite certain that in 1415, Henry V., full of
his French schemes and ambitions, and with no
longer any cause to trouble himself about Wales,
sent a special message of pardon to Glyndwr. Perhaps
the young King felt a touch of generous admiration
for the brave old warrior who had been the
means of teaching him so much of the art of war
and the management of men, and who, though alone
and friendless, was too proud to ask a favour or to
bend his knee. Sir Gilbert Talbot of Grafton,
in Worcestershire, was the man picked out by
Henry to accomplish this gracious act. Nothing,
however, came of it immediately. Perhaps the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>304]</a></span>
great campaign of Poitiers interfered with a matter
so comparatively trifling. But on the King&rsquo;s
return he renewed it in February, 1416, commissioning
this time not only Talbot but Glyndwr&rsquo;s own
son, Meredith, as envoys. Whether or no it would
have even now and by such a channel been acceptable
is of no consequence, as the old hero was
either dead or in concealment. Common sense inclines
to the most logical and most generally accepted
of the traditions which surround his last
years, namely, the one which pictures him resting
quietly after his stormy life at the home of one or
other of his married daughters in Herefordshire.
Monnington and Kentchurch both claim the honour
of having thus sheltered him. Probably they both
did, seeing how near they lie together, though the
people of the former place stoutly maintain that it
is in their churchyard his actual dust reposes.</p>

<p>At Kentchurch Court, where his daughter Alice
Scudamore lived with her husband, and which still belongs
to the family, a tower of the building is even
yet cherished as the lodging of the fallen chieftain
during part at any rate of these last years of obscurity.
The romantic beauty of the spot, the survival
of the mansion and of the stock that own it,
would make us wish to give Kentchurch everything
it claims, and more, in connection with Glyndwr&rsquo;s
last days. Above the Court, which stands in a hollow
embowered in woods, a park or chase climbs for
many hundred feet up the steep sides of Garaway
Hill, which in its unconventional wildness and entire
freedom from any modernising touch is singularly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>305]</a></span>
in keeping with the ancient memories of the
place. The deer brush beneath oaks and yews of
such prodigious age and size that some of them
must almost certainly have been of good size when
Thomas Scudamore brought Alice, the daughter of
Owen of Glyndyfrdwy, home as a bride; while just
across the narrow valley, through which the waters
of the Monnow rush swift and bright between their
ruddy banks, the village and ruined castle of Grosmont
stand conspicuous upon their lofty ridge. It
must in fairness to the claims of Monnington be remembered
that Grosmont was not precisely the object
upon which Glyndwr, if he were still susceptible
to such emotions, would have wished his fading eyesight
to dwell long, since of all the spots in Wales (and
it is just in Wales, the Monnow being the boundary)
Grosmont had been the one most pregnant, perhaps,
with evil to his cause. For it was the defeat of
Glyndwr&rsquo;s forces there that may be said to have
broken the back of his rebellion. And as we stand
upon the bridge over the Monnow midway between
England and Wales, the still stately ruins of the
Norman castle that must often have echoed to
Prince Henry&rsquo;s cheery voice crown the hill beyond
us; while behind it the quaint village that rose upon
the ashes of the town Glyndwr burnt, with all its
civic dignities, looks down upon us, the very essence
of rural peace.</p>

<p>Glyndwr&rsquo;s estates had long ago been forfeited to
the Crown and granted to John, Earl of Somerset.
Soon after his death Glyndyfrdwy was sold
to the Salusburys of Bachymbyd and of R&ucirc;g near
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>306]</a></span>
Corwen, one of the very few alien families that in a
peaceful manner had become landowners in North
Wales before the Edwardian conquest. It is only
recently indeed that there has ceased to be a Salusbury
of R&ucirc;g. Owen&rsquo;s descendants, through his
daughters, at any rate, are numerous. A few years
after his death, Parliament, softening towards his
memory, passed a special law for the benefit of his
heirs, allowing them to retain or recover a portion of
the proscribed estates. In consequence of this, Alice
Scudamore made an effort to recover Glyndyfrdwy
and Sycherth from the Earl of Somerset apparently
without success, so far as the former went, in view of
the early ownership of the Salusburys.</p>

<p>Of Griffith, the son who was so long a prisoner in
the Tower in company with the young King of
Scotland, we hear nothing more. But of Meredith
this entry occurs in the Rolls of Henry V., 1421:
&ldquo;Pardon of Meredith son of Owynus de Glendordy
according to the sacred precept that the son shall
not bear the iniquities of the father.&rdquo; To another
daughter of Glyndwr, probably an illegitimate one,
Gwenllian, wife of Phillip ap Rhys of Cenarth, the
famous bard, Lewis Glyncothi, wrote various poems,
in one of which he says: &ldquo;Your father was a potent
prince, all Wales was in his council.&rdquo;</p>

<p>No intelligent person of our day could regret the
failure of Glyndwr&rsquo;s heroic effort. That Welshmen
of the times we have been treating of should have
longed to shake off the yoke of the Anglo-Norman
was but human, for he was not only a bad master,
but a foreigner and wholly antipathetic to the Celtic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>307]</a></span>
nature. At the same time, the geographical absurdity,
if the word may be permitted, of complete
independence was frankly recognised by almost
every Welsh patriot from earliest times. The notion
of a suzerain or chief king in London, as I have
remarked elsewhere, was quite in harmony with the
most passionate of Welsh demands. Glyndwr perhaps
had other views; but then the kingdom that
he would fain have ruled, if the Tripartite Convention
is to be relied on, stretched far beyond the narrow
bounds of Wales proper and quite matched in
strength either of the other two divisions which,
under this fantastic scheme, Mortimer and Percy
were respectively to govern. What was undoubtedly
galling to the Welsh was the spectacle of a province
to the north of the island, consisting, so far as the
bulk of its power and civilisation was concerned, of
these same hated Anglo-Normans, not only claiming
and maintaining an entire independence on no basis
that a Celt could recognise, but trafficking continuously
with foreign enemies in a fashion that showed
them to be destitute of any feeling for the soil of
Britain beyond that part which they themselves had
seized. To the long-memoried Welshman it seemed
hard, and no doubt illogical, that these interlopers,
one practically in blood and speech and feeling with
their own oppressors, should thus be permitted to
set up a rival independence within the borders of
the island, while they on their part were forced to
fuse themselves with a people who could not even
understand their tongue and with whom they had
scarcely a sentiment in common. It is difficult not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>308]</a></span>
to sympathise with the medi&aelig;val Welshman in this
attitude or to refrain from wondering at the strange
turn of fortune that allowed the turbulent ambition
of some Norman barons to draw an artificial
line and create a northern province, which their descendants,
if they showed much vigour in its defence,
showed very little aptitude for governing with reasonable
equity.</p>

<p>Glyndwr, it is true, had thrown off the old British
tradition and had called in foreigners from across
the sea, as Vortigern to his cost had done nearly a
thousand years before. He had also adopted a
French Pope. Neither had done him much good,
and Welshmen were soon as ready as ever to fight
their late brief allies for the honour of the island of
Britain. But Glyndwr from an early period in his
insurrection had kept the one aim, that of the independence
of his country, dream though it might
be, consistently in view. No means were to be
neglected, even to the ruining of its fields and the
destruction of its buildings, to obtain this end. How
thoroughly he carried out his views has been sufficiently
emphasised; so thoroughly, indeed, as to
cause many good Welshmen to refrain from wholly
sharing in the veneration shown for his memory by
the bulk of his countrymen. There can be but one
opinion, however, as to the marvellous courage with
which he clung to the tree of liberty that he had
planted and watered with such torrents of human
blood, till in literal truth he found himself the last
leaf upon its shrunken limbs, and that a withered
one. In the heyday of his glory his household bard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>309]</a></span>
and laureate wrote much extravagant verse in his
honour, as was only natural and in keeping with the
fancy of the period and of his class. But the Red
Iolo himself, in all likelihood, little realised the
prophetic ring in the lines he addressed to his
master on the closing of his earthly course, though
we, at least, have ample evidence of their prescience:</p>

<br />
<span class="vsmlfont">CONCLUSION</span></h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>S I have led up to the advent of Glyndwr with
a rough outline of Welsh history prior to his
day, I will now cast a brief glance at the
period which followed. English people have a tendency
to underestimate, or rather to take into small
consideration, the wide gulf which, not only in former
days, but to some extent even yet, divides the two
countries. They are apt to think that after the
abortive rising of Glyndwr, provided even this
stands out clearly in their minds, everything went
smoothly and Wales became merely a geographical
expression with an eccentric passion for maintaining
its own language. As, in the introduction to this
book, I had to solicit the patience of the general
reader and crave the forbearance of the expert for
an effort to cover centuries in a few pages, so I
must again put in a plea for another venture of the
same kind&mdash;briefer, but none the less difficult.</p>

<p>The ruin left by Glyndwr&rsquo;s war was awful. It
was not only the loss of property, the destruction of
buildings, the sterilisation of lands, but the quarrels
and the blood-feuds which the soreness of these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>311]</a></span>
years of strife handed down for generations to the
descendants of those who had taken opposing sides.
And then before prosperity had fairly lifted its
head, before bloody quarrels and memories had
been forgotten, the devastating Wars of the Roses
were upon the country, and it was plunged once
more into a chaos not much less distracting than
that in which the preceding generation had weltered.</p>

<p>Though, by a curious turn of events, she ultimately
gave to England a Lancastrian king, Wales most
naturally favoured the House of York. Edmund
Mortimer, uncle to the young Earl of March, had
shared the triumphs and the perils of Glyndwr&rsquo;s rising.
The blood of Llewelyn ap Iorwerth flowed in
the veins of the Mortimers, and their great estates
lay chiefly in Wales and on the border. The old
antagonism to Bolingbroke&rsquo;s usurpation, and the
sympathy with Richard and his designated heir that
half a century before accompanied it, were still remembered.
The Yorkists, however, had no monopoly
of Wales,&mdash;Welsh knights had fought victoriously
in France under Henry V., and Marcher
barons of Lancastrian sympathies could command
a considerable following of Welshmen. The old
confusion of lordship government still retained half
Wales as a collection of small palatinates. Once
more the castles that Glyndwr had left standing
echoed to the bustle of preparation and the stir of
arms, and felt the blows of an artillery that they
could no longer face with quite the composure with
which they had faced the guns of Henry the Fourth.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>312]</a></span>
It was not so much the actual damage that was done,
for this war was not so comprehensive, but rather
the passions and faction it aroused among the Welsh
gentry of both races, though this new faction no
longer ran strictly upon racial lines. Nor, again,
was it the amount of blood that was shed, for this
compared to Glyndwr&rsquo;s war was inconsiderable, but
the legacy, rather, of lawlessness that it left behind.
Sir John Wynne of Gwydir, in the invaluable chronicle
which he wrote at his home in the Vale of Conway
during the reign of Elizabeth, draws a graphic
picture of North Wales as Henry the Seventh found
it. Sir John&rsquo;s immediate forbears had taken a brisk
hand in the doings of those distracted times, and
there were still men living when he wrote who had
seen the close of the chaos with their own eyes, and
whose minds were stored with the evidence of their
fathers and grandfathers. Harlech in these wars
stood once more a noted siege. It was held for the
Lancastrians by a valiant Welshman against the
Herberts, who made a somewhat celebrated march
through the mountains to besiege it. The stout defence
it offered inspired the music and the words of
the Welsh national march, &ldquo;Men of Harlech,&rdquo;&mdash;as
spirited an air of its kind, perhaps, as has ever been
written. The Vale of Clwyd, the garden of North
Wales, was burnt, says Sir John, &ldquo;to cold coals.&rdquo;
Landowners who had mortgaged their estates, he
goes on to tell us, scarcely thought them worth redeeming,
while the deer grazed in the very streets
of Llanrwst. For two or three generations the
country was infested by bands of robbers who found
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>313]</a></span>
refuge in the mountains of Merioneth or the wild
uplands of the Berwyn Range, and fought for the
privilege of systematically plundering and levying
blackmail on the Vale of Conway and the richer
meadows of Edeyrnion. Sir John&rsquo;s grandfather
found it necessary to go to church attended by a
bodyguard of twenty men armed to the teeth. &ldquo;The
red-haired banditti of Mawddy&rdquo; kept the country
between the Dovey and Mawddach estuaries and inland
nearly to Shropshire in a state of chronic terror.
The Carnarvon squires cherished blood-feuds
that almost resembled a vendetta, laid siege to one
another&rsquo;s houses, and engaged in mimic battles of a
truly bloodthirsty description. The first Wynne of
Gwydir left West Carnarvonshire and preferred to
live among the brigands of the Vale of Conway
rather than among his own relatives, since he would
&ldquo;either have to kill or be killed by them.&rdquo; To try and
combat these organised bands of robbers, Edward
IV. instituted, in 1478, the Court of the President
and Council of the Marches of Wales, with summary
jurisdiction over all breakers of the peace&mdash;provided
always that they could catch them! The legal
machinery of the lordships was wholly ineffectual,
for though each petty monarch had the power of
life and death, the harbouring of thieves and outlaws
became a matter purely of personal rivalry and
jealousy.</p>

<p>But this epoch of Welsh history ended with the
advent of the Tudors, which is in truth an even
more notable landmark than the so-called conquest
of Edward I. Wales since that time had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>314]</a></span>
governed as a conquered country, or a Crown province&mdash;she
had been annexed but not united, nor had she
been represented in Parliament, while outside the
Edwardian counties justice was administered, or
more often not administered, by two or three score
of petty potentates. One must not, however, make
too much of what we now call union and patriotism.
Cheshire had been till quite recently an independent
earldom, with similar relations to the Crown as the
lordship, say, of Ruthin or of Hay. As regards national
feeling, it is very doubtful if the sentiments
that had animated the heptarchy had been eradicated
from that turbulent palatinate who boasted
the best archers in England and were extremely
jealous of their licentious independence.</p>

<p>But it was a pure accident that in the end really
reconciled the Welsh to a close union with the hated
Saxon. Steeped as they were in sentiment, and
credulous to a degree of mysticism and prophecy, and
filled with national pride, the rise of the grandson of
Owen Tudor of Penmynydd to the throne of Britain
was for the Cymry full of significance. The fact, too,
that Henry was not merely a Welshman but that he
landed in Wales and was accompanied thence by a
large force of his fellow-countrymen to the victorious
field of Bosworth was a further source of pride and
consolation to this long-harassed people. It would
be hard indeed to exaggerate the effect upon Wales
and its future relationship with England, when a
curious chain of events elevated this once obscure
princeling to the throne of England. It was strange,
too, that it should be a Lancastrian after all whose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>315]</a></span>
accession caused such joy and triumph throughout
a province which had shed its blood so largely upon
the opposing side. The bards were of course in ecstasies;
the prophecy that a British prince should
once again reign in London&mdash;which had faded away
into a feeble echo, without heart or meaning, since
the downfall of Glyndwr&mdash;now astonished with its
sudden fulfilment the expounders of Merlin and the
Brut as completely as it did the audience to whom
they had so long foretold this unlikely consummation.
Not for a moment, however, we may well believe, was
such a surprise admitted nor the difference in the
manner of its fulfilment. But who indeed would carp
at that when the result was so wholly admirable? It is
not our business to trace the tortuous ways by which
fate removed the more natural heirs to the throne and
seated upon it for the great good of England as
well as of Wales the grandson of an Anglesey squire
of ancient race and trifling estate.</p>

<p>That the first Tudor disappointed his fellow-countrymen
in some of their just expectations, and
behaved in fact somewhat meanly to them, is of no
great consequence since his burly son made such
ample amends for the shortcomings of his father.
The matrimonial barbarities of Henry the Eighth
and his drastic measures in matters ecclesiastical
have made him so marked a personage that men forget
and indeed are not very clearly made to understand
what he did for Wales, and consequently for
England too.</p>

<p>By an Act of Parliament in 1535 the whole of the
Lordship Marcher system was swept away, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>316]</a></span>
modern counties of Denbigh, Montgomery, Monmouth,
Glamorgan, Brecon, and Radnor were formed
out of the fragments. It is only possible to generalise
within such compass as this. The precise details belong
rather to antiquarian lore and would be out of
place here. It will be sufficient to say that the Welsh
people of all degrees, after waiting with laudable
patience for their first King to do something practical
on their behalf, petitioned Henry the Eighth to
abolish the disorders under which half their country
groaned and to grant that representation in Parliament
as yet enjoyed by no part of the Principality,
and without which true equality could not exist.
The King appointed a commission to carry out their
wishes. The sources from which the new counties
took their names, though following no rule, are
obvious enough. Glamorgan, the old Morganwg, had
been practically a County Palatine since Fitzhamon
and his twelve knights seized it in Henry the First&rsquo;s
time, that is to say, the inferior lordships were held
in fealty, not each to the King as elsewhere, but to
the heirs of Fitzhamon, who for many generations
were the Clares, Earls of Gloucester, having their
capital at Cardiff, where higher justice was administered.
Pembroke was something of the same sort,
though the Flemish element made it differ socially
from Glamorgan. Nor must it be forgotten that
that promontory of Gower in the latter palatinate was
a Flemish lordship. But Pembroke was the actual
property of the Crown and its earls or lords were
practically constables. The rest of the Marches (for
this term signified all Wales outside the Edwardian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>317]</a></span>
counties) had no such definitions. That they followed
no common rule was obvious enough. Brecon took
its name from the old lordship of Brecheiniog that
Bernard de Newmarch had founded in Henry the
First&rsquo;s time. The old Melynydd, more or less, became
Radnor, after its chief fortress and lordship.
Montgomery derived its shire name from the high-perched
castle above the Severn, Monmouth from
the town at the Monnow&rsquo;s mouth. Large fragments
of the Marches, too, were tacked on to the
counties of Hereford and Shropshire, the Welsh
border as we know it to-day being in many places
considerably westward of the old line. All the
old lordship divisions with the privileges and responsibilities
of their owners were abolished, and
the castles, which had only existed for coercive
and defensive purposes, began gradually from
this time to subside into those hoary ruins
which from a hundred hilltops give the beautiful
landscape of South Wales a distinction that is probably
unmatched in this particular in northern Europe.
County government was uniformly introduced all
over Wales and the harsh laws of Glyndwr&rsquo;s day, for
some time a dead letter, were erased from the statutes.
Parliamentary representation was allotted, though
only one knight instead of two sat for a shire
and one burgess only for all the boroughs
of a shire; and the two countries became
one in heart as well as in fact. Till 1535 the eldest
son of English Kings, as Prince of Wales, had
been all that the name implies. Henceforth it
became a courtesy title; and one may perhaps be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>318]</a></span>
allowed a regret, having regard to the temperament of
a Celtic race in this particular, that our English
monarchs have allowed it to remain so wholly
divorced from all Welsh connection. The last actual
Prince of Wales was Henry the Eighth&rsquo;s elder
brother Arthur, who died at the then official residence
of Ludlow Castle a few weeks after his marriage
with Catherine of Aragon.</p>

<p>This reminds me too that one peculiarity remained
to distinguish the administration of Wales from that
of England, namely that famous and long-lived institution,
the &ldquo;Court of the Marches.&rdquo; This has
already been mentioned as introduced by Edward the
Fourth, who was friendly to Wales, for the suppression
of outlaws and brigands. It was confirmed and
its powers enlarged by Henry the Eighth&rsquo;s Act, and
with headquarters at Ludlow, though sitting sometimes
at Shrewsbury and Chester, it was the appeal
for all important Welsh litigation. Nor was it in
any sense regarded as a survival of arbitrary treatment.
On the contrary, it was a convenience to
Welshmen, who could take cases there that people
in North Yorkshire, for instance, would have to carry
all the way to Westminster. For a long time, curiously
enough, its jurisdiction extended into the
counties of Worcester, Gloucester, Hereford, and
Salop. It consisted of a president and council with
a permanent staff of subordinate officials. The
presidency was an office of great honour, held
usually by a bishop or baron of weight in the
country, associated with the two justices of Wales and
that of Chester. The arrangement seems to have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>319]</a></span>
caused general satisfaction till the reign of William
the Third, when the growth of industry and population
made it advisable to divide Wales into circuits.</p>

<p>The petitions addressed from the Welsh people
to Henry praying for complete fusion with England
are instructive reading. Marcher rule at the worst
had been infamously cruel, at the best inconvenient
and inequitable. It was a disgrace to the civilisation
of the fifteenth century, which is saying a great deal.
To bring criminals to justice was almost impossible
when they had only to cross into the next lordship,
whose ruler, being unfriendly perhaps to his neighbour,
made it a point of honour to harbour those
who defied him. The still martial spirit of the
Welsh found vent when wars had ceased in petty
quarrels, and with such a turbulent past it did them
credit that they recognised how sorely even-handed
justice was wanted among them.</p>

<p>Lordship Marchers themselves were too often represented
by deputies, and something like the abuses
that were familiar in Ireland in more recent times
owing to middlemen added to the confusion.
According to local custom the humbler people of
one lordship might not move eight paces from the
road as they passed through a neighbouring territory.
The penalty for transgression was all the money
they had about them and the joint of one finger.
If cattle strayed across the lordship boundary they
could be kept and branded by the neighbouring lord
or his representatives.</p>

<p>In the aforesaid petitions sent up to Henry VIII.
the petitioners dwell upon their loyalty to the throne
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>320]</a></span>
and the unhappy causes that had alienated them
from it in the past. They remind him of how they
fought in France for Edward III., and of their
loyalty to Richard II., which was the sole cause, they
declare, of their advocacy of Glyndwr. They indignantly
declare that they are not &ldquo;runaway Britons
as some call us,&rdquo; but natives of a country which
besides defending itself received all those who came
to it for succour at the period alluded to. Resenting
the imputation of barrenness sometimes cast on
their country, they declare that &ldquo;even its highest
mountains afford beef and mutton, not only to ourselves,
but supply England in great quantity.&rdquo; They
recall the fact that they were Christians while the
Saxons were still heathen. They combat those
critics who describe their language as uncouth and
strange and dwell on its antiquity and purity. If it
is spoken from the throat, say these petitioners,
&ldquo;the Spanish and Florentines affect that pronunciation
as believing words so uttered come from the
heart.&rdquo; Finally, with presumably unconscious satire,
they allude to the speech of the northern part of
the island as &ldquo;a kind of English.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Henry accomplished these great reforms in the
teeth of the baronial influence of the whole Marches,
and if the slaughter of the Wars of the Roses had
made his task somewhat easier, he should have full
credit for achieving a piece of legislation whose importance
as an epoch-marking event could hardly
be exaggerated, not only as affecting Wales but the
four powerful counties that adjoined it.</p>

<p>To create and organise six new counties out of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>321]</a></span>
chaos, to enfranchise and give representation to
twelve, to permanently attach one of the three
tributary kingdoms to the British Crown, is a performance
that should be sufficient to lift the reign
of a monarch out of the common run. Every
schoolboy is familiar with the figure of Henry VIII.
prancing in somewhat purposeless splendour on the
Field of the Cloth of Gold. But who remembers
the assimilation of Wales to England which was his
doing?</p>

<p>Wales, though small in population, was numerically
much greater in proportion to England than is
now the case. To-day she is a twentieth, then perhaps
she was nearly a seventh, of the whole. It was of
vital importance that her people should be satisfied
and well governed. The accession of the Tudors
and the common sense of their second monarch
achieved without difficulty what might have been a
long and arduous business.</p>

<p>The palmy days of Elizabeth saw Wales, like
England, advance by leaps and bounds. The native
gentry, the tribesmen, the &ldquo;Boneddigion,&rdquo; always
pressing on the Norman aristocracy, now came again
in wholesale fashion to the front. The grim castle
and the fortified manor developed into the country
house. Polite learning increased and the upper
classes abandoned, in a manner almost too complete,
the native tongue. The higher aristocracy, taking
full and free part in English life, became by degrees
wholly Anglicised, and the habit, though very gradually,
spread downwards throughout the whole gentry
class. The Reformation had been accepted with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>322]</a></span>
great reluctance in Wales. The people were conservative
by instinct and loyal to all such constituted
authorities as they held in affection. They would
take anything, however, for that very reason, from
the Tudors, and swallowed, or partly swallowed, a
pill that was by no means to their liking. In Elizabeth&rsquo;s
time the Bible and Prayer-Book were translated
into Welsh, which marked another epoch in
the history of Wales much greater than it at first
sounds. It was not done without opposition: the
desire in official circles to stamp out the native
language, which became afterward so strong, had
already germinated, and it was thought that retaining
the Scriptures and the Service in English would
encourage its acquisition among the people. The
prospects, however, in the actual practice did not
seem encouraging, and in the meantime the souls of
the Welsh people were starving for want of nourishment.
The Welsh Bible and Prayer-Book proved
an infinite boon to the masses of the nation, but it
did more than anything else to fix the native tongue.</p>

<p>Wales readily transformed its affection for the
Tudors into loyalty for the Stuarts. The Church,
too, was strong&mdash;the bent of the people being averse
to Puritanism, and indeed nowhere in Britain did
the survivals of popery linger so long as among the
Welsh mountains. Even to-day, amid the uncongenial
atmosphere that a century of stern Calvinism
has created, some unconscious usages and expressions
of the peasantry in remoter districts preserve
its traces. The Civil War found Wales staunch almost
to a man for the King. There were some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>323]</a></span>
Roundheads in the English part of Pembroke, as
was natural, and a few leading families elsewhere
were found upon the Parliamentary side. Such of
the castles as had not too far decayed were furbished
up and renewed the memories of their stormy
prime under circumstances far more injurious
to their masonry. Harlech, Chirk, Denbigh, Conway,
and many others made notable defences. The
violent loyalty of Wales brought down upon it the
heavy hand of Cromwell, though himself a Welshman
by descent. The landed gentry were ruined or
crippled, and the prosperity of the country greatly
thrown back. It is said that the native language
took some hold again of the upper classes from the
fact of their poverty keeping them at home, whereas
they had been accustomed to flock to the English
universities and the border grammar schools, such
as Shrewsbury, Chester, or Ludlow. Welsh poetry
and literature expended itself in abuse of that Puritanism
which in a slightly different form was later
on to find in Wales its chosen home. But in all this
there was of course little trace of the old international
struggles. The Civil War was upon altogether
different lines. The attitude of Wales was,
in fact, merely that of most of the west of England
somewhat emphasised.</p>

<p>Smitten in prosperity, the Principality moved
slowly along to better times in the wake of England,
under the benevolent neutrality of the later Stuarts
and of William and Anne. It still remained a great
stronghold in outward things, at any rate, of the
Church, and kept alive what Defoe, travelling there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>324]</a></span>
in Anne&rsquo;s reign, calls &ldquo;many popish customs,&rdquo;
such as playing foot-ball between the services on
Sunday, and retiring to drink at the public house,
which was sometimes, he noted, kept by the parson,
while even into the eighteenth century funeral processions
halted at the crossroads and prayed for the
soul of the dead. The Welsh landowning families
were numerous and poor, proud of their pedigrees,
which unlike the Anglo-Norman had a full thousand
years for genealogical facts or fancies to play over.
At the beginning of the eighteenth century there
were very few wealthy landowners in Wales who
stood out above the general level, which was perhaps
a rude and rollicking one. There was no middle class,
for there were neither trade nor manufactures worth
mentioning, and little shifting from one class to another.
Hence the genealogy was simple, and consequently,
perhaps, more accurate than in wealthier
societies. The mixture of English blood over most
of the country was almost nil among the lower
class, and not great even among the gentry.</p>

<p>The peasantry still submitted themselves without
question to their own social leaders, and the latter,
though they had mostly abandoned their own language,
still took a pride in old customs and traditions,
were generous, hospitable, quarrelsome, and
even more addicted to convivial pleasures than their
English contemporaries of that class. Defoe was at
a cocking match in Anglesey and sat down to dinner
with forty squires of the island. &ldquo;They talked in
English,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;but swore in Welsh.&rdquo; That
the Welsh gentleman of the present day, unlike his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>325]</a></span>
prototype of Scotland or Ireland, shows no trace worth
mentioning of his nationality is curious when one
thinks how much farther removed he usually is in
blood from the Englishman than either. It should
be remembered, however, that there were no seats of
learning in Wales such as Ireland and Scotland possessed.
The well-to-do young Welshman went naturally
to England for his education, even in days
when difficulties of travelling were in favour of even
indifferent local institutions.</p>

<p>Surnames became customary in Wales about the
time of the Tudor settlement; previously only a few
men of literary distinction had adopted them, such
as Owen Cyfylliog, Prince of Upper Powys, Dafydd
Hiraethog, etc. The inconvenience of being distinguished
only by the names of his more recent ancestors
connected by &ldquo;ab&rdquo; or &ldquo;ap&rdquo; was found intolerable
by the Welshman and his English friends as life got
more complex. It is said that Henry VIII. was
anxious for the Welsh landowners to assume the
name of their estates in the old Anglo-Norman fashion,
and it is a pity his suggestion was not followed,
in part at any rate. But the current Christian name
of the individual was adopted instead and saddled
for ever on each man&rsquo;s descendants. So a language
full of euphonious place-names and sonorous sounds
shows the paradox of the most inconveniently limited
and perhaps the poorest family nomenclature in
Europe.</p>

<p>In 1735, just two hundred years after its complete
union with England, began the movement that was in
time to change all Wales, I had almost said the very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>326]</a></span>
Welsh character itself. This was the Methodist revival.
All Welshmen were then Church people.
The landed families for the most part supplied the
parishes with incumbents, grouping them no doubt
as much as possible so as to create incomes sufficient
for a younger son to keep a humble curate and ruffle
it with his lay relatives over the bottle and in the
field. The peasantry may have been cheery and
happy, but they were sunk in ignorance. They
seem, however, to have been good churchgoers&mdash;the
old instinct of discipline perhaps surviving&mdash;but the
spiritual consolation they received there was lamentably
deficient, and the Hanoverian r&eacute;gime was making
matters steadily worse. Its political bishops rarely
came near their Welsh dioceses. All the higher
patronage was given to English absentees, for the
poor Welsh squires could be of little political service
and had no equivalent wherewith to pay for a deanery
or a canon&rsquo;s stall. To be a Welshman, in fact,
was then, and for more than a century later when
the landed class had nearly ceased to enter the
Church, of itself a bar to advancement. The mental
alertness and religious fervour, however, of the
Welsh people had only lain dormant under circumstances
so discouraging, and were far from dead.
They presented a rare field for the efforts of the religious
reformer, though it seems more than likely
that the beauty and ritual of an awakened Anglican
Church would have appealed to their natures more
readily even than the eloquence of the Calvinistic
school that eventually led them captive. The Welsh
people were imaginative, reverential, musical. Their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>327]</a></span>
devotion to the old faith in both its forms was sufficiently
shown by the pathetic fidelity with which
they clung to their mother churches till, both physically
and mentally, they tumbled about their ears.</p>

<p>The Methodist revivalists of the eighteenth century
were, as everyone knows, for the most part
Churchmen. Many of them were in orders, valiant
and devoted men, who not only preached in the
highways and hedges, but founded schools all over
Wales, whose peasantry at that time were almost
without education. They suffered every kind of
persecution and annoyance from the Church, while
the country clergy headed mobs who treated them
with physical violence. No effort was made to meet
this new rival upon its own grounds,&mdash;those of ministerial
energy and spiritual devotion,&mdash;but its exponents
were met only with rotten eggs. The bishops
were not merely absentees for the most part, but
from 1700 to 1870 they were consistently Englishmen,
ignorant of the Welsh tongue, and regarded in
some sort as agents for the Anglicising of Wales.
Men who with some exceptions were destitute of
qualifications for their office found themselves in
positions that would have taxed abilities of the
highest order and all the energies of a modern prelate.
The holders of Welsh sees laid neither such
slender stocks of ability nor energy as they might
possess under the slightest contribution on behalf of
Welsh religion. With the funds of the Church,
however, they observed no such abstention, but saddled
the needy Welsh Establishment with a host of
relatives and friends. As for themselves, with a few
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>328]</a></span>
notable exceptions they cultivated a dignified leisure,
sometimes at their palaces, more often in London
or Bath. One prelate never saw his diocese at all,
while another lived entirely in Cumberland. With
the Methodist revival one could not expect them to
sympathise, nor is it surprising that their good
wishes were with the militant pot-house parsons who
were in favour of physical force. One must remember
after all, however, that this was the Hogarthian
period; that in all these features of life England was
at its worst; and that the faults of the time were
only aggravated in Wales by its aloofness and its
lingual complications. The Welsh Methodist, it is
true, did not formally leave the Church till 1811,
but by that time Calvinism had thoroughly taken
hold of the country, and the Establishment had not
only made no spiritual efforts to stem the tide, but
was rapidly losing even its social influence, as the
upper classes were ceasing to take service in its
ranks. The Welsh parson of indifferent morals and
lay habits had hitherto generally been of the landowning
class. Now he was more often than not of a
humbler grade without any compensating improvement
in morals or professional assiduity. The immense
development of dissent in Wales during the
last century is a matter of common knowledge. The
purifying of the Welsh Church and clergy in the latter
half of it and the revival of Anglican energy within
the last quarter are marked features of modern Welsh
life. We have nothing to do here with the probabilities
of a success so tardily courted. But it is of pertinent
interest to consider the immense changes that have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>329]</a></span>
come over Wales since, let us say, the middle of the
Georgian period; and by this I do not merely mean
those caused by a material progress common to the
whole of Great Britain. For there is much reason to
think that the character of the Welsh peasantry has
been steadily altering, particularly in the more thoroughly
Welsh districts, since they fell under the influence
of Calvinistic doctrines. There is much
evidence that the old Welshman was a merry, light-hearted
person, of free conversation and addicted to
such amusements as came in his way; that he still
had strong military instincts,<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> and cherished feudal
attachments to the ancient families of Wales even
beyond the habit of the time among the English.
This latter instinct has died hard, considering the
cleavage that various circumstances have created between
the landed gentry and the peasantry. Indeed
it is by no means yet dead.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_16_16" id="Footnote_16_16"></a><a href="#FNanchor_16_16"><span class="label">[16]</span></a>
Recent events have demonstrated that this spirit is still far from
extinct. <a href="#FNanchor_16_16">Back</a></p>
</div>

<p>The drift of the native tongue, too, since Tudor
times has been curious. Its gradual abandonment
by the landed gentry from that period onwards, with
the tenacity with which their tenants for the most
part clung to it, is a subject in itself. The resistance
it still offers in spots that may be fairly described as
in the very centre of the world&rsquo;s civilisation is probably
the most striking lingual anomaly in Europe.
Its disappearance, on the other hand, in regions intensely
Welsh is worthy of note. Radnorshire, for
instance, penetrating the very heart of the Principality,
populated almost wholly by Cymry, forgot
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>330]</a></span>
its Welsh before anyone now living can remember.
Bits of Monmouth, on the other hand, long reckoned
an English county, still use it regularly. It is the
household tongue of villagers in Flint, who can see
Liverpool from their windows, while there are large
communities of pure Celts in Brecon and Carmarthen
who cannot even understand it.</p>

<p>The great coal developments in South Wales have
wholly transformed large regions and brought great
wealth into the country, and replaced the abundant
rural life of Glamorgan and its ancient families,
Welsh and Norman, with a black country that has
developed a new social life of its own. Slate quarrying
has proved a vast and profitable industry among
the northern mountains, while thousands of tourists
carry no inconsiderable stream of wealth across the
Marches with every recurring summer. But neither
coal-pits, nor quarries, nor tourists make much impression
on the Welsh character such as it has become
in the North, more particularly under the influence of
Calvinism, and very little upon the language which
fifty years ago men were accustomed to regard as
doomed.</p>

<p>The history of Welsh land since the time of the
Tudor settlement is but that of many parts of England.
Wales till this century was distinguished for
small properties and small tenancies. There were
but few large proprietors and few large farmers. In
the matter of the former particularly, things have
greatly altered. The small squires who lived somewhat
rudely in diminutive manor-houses have been
swallowed up wholesale by their thriftier or bigger
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>331]</a></span>
neighbours, but the general and now regretted tendency
to consolidate farms scarcely touched Wales,
fortunately for that country. Save in a few exceptional
districts it is a land of small working farmers,
and in most parts the resident agricultural labourer
as a detached class scarcely exists.</p>

<p>Few countries in the world contain within the
same area more elements of prosperity and happiness
than modern Wales, and fewer still are so fortunately
situated for making the most of them. Coal, iron,
slate, and other minerals in great abundance are vigorously
exported and give work and good wages to a
large portion of the population. In the rural districts
a thrifty peasantry are more widely distributed over
the soil, to which they are peculiarly attached, than in
almost any part of Britain, and occupied for the
most part in the more hopeful and less toilsome of
the two branches of agriculture, namely, that of stock-breeding.
Surrounded on three sides by the sea,
there are ready facilities for the trader, the sailor, or
the fisherman. The romantic scenery of the country
is another valuable asset to its people and brings an
annual and certain income that only one small corner
of England can show any parallel to. Education is
in an advanced state, while the humbler classes of
society have resources due to their taste for music and
their sentiment for their native language, which have
no equivalent in English village life.</p>

<p>Even those strangely constituted minds that like
to dig up racial grievances from the turmoil of the
Middle Ages, when right and might were synonymous
words the world over, and profess to judge the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>332]</a></span>
fourteenth century by the ethics of the nineteenth,
must confess that the forced partnership with England
has had its compensations. The reasonable
Welshman will look back rather with much complaisance
on the heroic and prolonged struggle of his
ancestors against manifest destiny, remembering
always that the policy of the Norman kings was
an obvious duty to themselves and to their realm.</p>

<p>Had the Ireland of that day, with its larger
fighting strength and sea-girt territory, possessed
the national spirit and tenacious courage of Wales,
who knows but that she might have vindicated
her right to a separate nationality by the only test
admissible in medi&aelig;val ethics, that of arms? Geography
at any rate in her case was no barrier to an
independent existence, and there would have been
nothing illogical or unnatural in the situation. But
geography irrevocably settled the destiny of Wales,
as it eventually did that of Scotland. If the conditions
under which Wales came into partnership
were different and the date earlier, that, again, was
partly due to its propinquity to the heart of England.
Yet with all these centuries of close affinity to England,
the Welsh in many respects&mdash;I had almost said
in most&mdash;have preserved their nationality more successfully
than the Celts of either Ireland or the
North, and in so doing have lost nothing of such
benefits as modern civilisation brings.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">APPENDIX<br />
<br />
<span class="vsmlfont">THE BARDS</span></h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE Bards as a class were so deeply interwoven
with the whole life of ancient Wales and, though
long shorn of most of their official glory, played
so prominent a part in the rising of Glyndwr, that it
seems desirable that a chapter touching on the subject
should be included in this book. Within such limits
the subject can only be treated in the most general
and elementary manner. Yet such treatment is excusable
from the fact that the slenderest and most
inefficient description of Welsh song and Welsh singers
must contain matter unknown to most English
readers. I imagine that few of these would resent
being asked to divest their minds of the time-honoured
notion that the teaching of the Druids was nothing
but a bloodthirsty and barbarous superstition.
At any rate, Bardism and Druidism being practically
the same thing, one is obliged to remind those readers
who may never have given the matter any attention
at all, that among the ancient Britons of the
Goidel stock who inhabited most of Wales and the
West previous to the Cymric immigration, Druidism
was the fountain of law, authority, religion, and,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>334]</a></span>
above all, of education. The Druids, with their three
orders, were a caste apart for which those who were
qualified by good character and noble birth to do so,
laboriously trained themselves. They decided all
controversies whether public or private, judged all
causes, from murder to boundary disputes, and administered
both rewards and punishments. Those
who ventured to defy them were excommunicated,
which was equivalent to becoming moral and social
lepers.</p>

<p>The three orders were known as Druids, Bards,
and Ovates. The first were priests and judges, the
second poets; the third were the least aristocratic,
practised the arts and sciences, and were, moreover, a
probationary or qualifying order through which candidates
for the other two, who were on the same level
of dignity, had to pass. As everyone knows, there
was an Arch-Druid of the Isle of Britain who had his
sanctuary in Anglesey. But it is a matter of much
less common knowledge how close was the connection
between the Druids and Christianity in the
Roman period and even afterwards. The Romans,
with conquest foremost in their minds, most naturally
aimed at the native rulers of the people and made
these bardic orders the objects of their special attack.
Their slaughter on the banks of the Menai as
described by Tacitus, and the destruction of the
Sacred Groves of Mona, are among our familiar
traditions.</p>

<p>The Druid orders fled to Ireland, Brittany, and
elsewhere. But in time, when the Romans, strong
in their seats, grew tolerant, the exiles returned and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>335]</a></span>
quietly resumed, in West Britain at any rate, something
like their old positions.</p>

<p>When Christianity pushed its way from the West
into the island, the bardic orders, unable to resist it,
seem by degrees to have accepted the situation and
to have become the priests of the new faith, as they
had been the custodians and expounders of the old.
This transition was the less difficult seeing that the
Druids preached all the ordinary tenets of morality,
and the immortality of the soul. To what extent the
early Christianity of western Britain was tainted
with the superstition of the Druids is a question upon
which experts have written volumes, and it need not
detain us here. A notable effort was made in the
fourth century to merge Christianity, so to speak, in
the old British faith, and Morgan or Pelagius, &ldquo;seaborn,&rdquo;
of Bangor Iscoed was the apostle of this attempted
reaction. He left the island about <small>A.D.</small> 400,
and his converts in what we now call Wales were
numerous and active. The movement is historically
known as the &ldquo;Pelagian heresy&rdquo; and has some additional
importance from the number of ecclesiastics
that came from over the sea for the purpose of
denouncing it.</p>

<p>But all this is rather the religious than the secular
side of Bardism, the leading feature of whose teaching
in pre-Roman days had been the committal to
memory of its literature, both prose and verse.
Writing was discountenanced, as the possession of
these stores of learning thus laboriously acquired
were a valuable asset of the initiated. Three was
the mystic number in the recitation of all axioms
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>336]</a></span>
and precepts, for many of these were committed to
writing later on in the seventh and tenth centuries,
and are now familiar as the Welsh &ldquo;Triads.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The bards, as a lay order, remained of great importance.
In the laws of Howel Dda (tenth century)
the royal bard stands eighth among the
officers of the State. The fine for insulting him
was six cows and twenty silver pennies. His value
was 126 cows, his land was free, and he had the use
of a house. His noblest duty was to sing &ldquo;The
Monarchy of Britain&rdquo; at the head of his chieftain&rsquo;s
army when victorious. The number of songs he
had to sing to the King and Queen respectively during
the social hours was clearly defined, as were his
claims upon each. Among the latter was a specified
portion of the spoils of war, a chessboard made
from the horn of a sea-fish from the King, and a ring
from the Queen. It was the business of the bards,
moreover, to preserve genealogies, and they were
practically tutors to the rising generation of the
aristocracy. Every family of position in Wales had
its domestic bard, while below these there were a
great number of strolling minstrels who visited the
dwellings of the inferior people, from whom they exacted
gifts of money (&ldquo;cymmorthau&rdquo;) as well as
free quarters.</p>

<p>In treating of individual and well-known bards
one naturally turns for a beginning to the sixth
century, when that famous quartet, Taliesin, Merddyn,
Aneurin, and Llywarch H&ecirc;n, flourished. Several
poems either actually their work or purporting
to be so are extant. To linger over a period so dim,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>337]</a></span>
however great the names that adorn it, would be out
of place here. That all four were great kings of
song in their time is beyond doubt. The legends
that distinguish them are comparatively familiar:
how Taliesin was found floating in a leather bottle
in Prince Elphin&rsquo;s salmon weir near Aberdovey, how
Merddyn as a boy astonished the advisers of Vortigern
and became his good angel, and how Llywarch
H&ecirc;n, at a hundred and fifty years of age, witnessed
the slaughter of the last of his four-and-twenty sons
in battle against the Saxons. His poem on the
death of Cynddylan, Prince of Powys, seizes the
imagination, not so much from the description the poet-warrior
gives of the death of his friend and his own
sons in a decisive combat which he himself took
part in, but from the almost certain fact that from
the top of the Wrekin he saw the Saxons destroy
and sack Uriconium (&ldquo;the white town&rdquo;), whose
ruins are such a striking feature among the sights
of Shropshire.</p>

<p>From these four giants until 1080 there is little
left whereby to judge of the merits of the bards, and
no great record of their names. That they sang and
played and gave counsel and kept genealogies is beyond
question, but it was not till after the Norman
conquest of England that they began to leave much
behind them in the way of written documents.</p>

<p>When Prince Griffith ap Kynan returned from
Ireland to Wales and the poet Meilir arose to sing
his triumphs and good qualities, a new era in bardic
history may be said to have commenced. The intellectual
and religious revival that distinguished the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>338]</a></span>
twelfth century in Western Europe was conspicuous
in Wales. The bards were no longer singing merely
of battles, but of nature and kindred subjects, with
a delicacy that showed them to be men of taste and
culture. In the twelfth, thirteenth, and fourteenth
centuries, in spite of war and conquest, the age was
a golden one in Welsh song. Between eighty and
ninety bards of this period have left poems behind
them as a witness of their various styles and merits,
while there are no literary remains whatever of very
many who are known to have been quite famous in
their day. Thousands, too, of popular songs must
have existed that the jealousy of the composers or,
more probably, the price of parchment consigned to
oblivion.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;When the literary revival of this period reached
Wales, its people,&rdquo; says Mr. Stephens in the <i>Literature
of the Kymri</i>, &ldquo;were better prepared than their neighbours
for intellectual effort.&rdquo; &ldquo;An order of bards existed,
numerous and well disciplined; a language in all
its fullness and richness was in use among all classes of
people, and as a necessary consequence their literature
was superior, more copious, and richer than that of any
contemporaneous nation. The fabulous literature so
prized by others was in no great repute, but gave way to
the public preference for the more laboured and artistic
productions of the bards.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Several Welsh Princes of commanding character
and unusual ability came to the front in the long
struggle with the Norman power, and were no
unworthy sources of bardic inspiration. Many of
them aspired themselves to literary as well as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>339]</a></span>
martial fame, of whom Owain Cyfeiliog, Prince of
Upper Powys, was the most notable. Poetry
was in high repute. Eisteddfodau were held periodically
with much ceremony and splendour, and were
sometimes advertised a year in advance, not only
throughout Wales but in Ireland and other portions
of the British Islands. Not poetry alone but literature
generally and music, of course, both vocal
and instrumental, were subjects of competition,
while Rhys ap Tudor, a long-lived and distinguished
Prince of South Wales, revived, after a sojourn in
Brittany, the system of the Round Table. To Englishmen
the long list of bards who adorned the
period between the Norman arrival and Glyndwr&rsquo;s
rising would be mere names, but even to those who
may only read the works of the most notable in
translations, they are of great interest if only as a
reflection of life and thought at a time when England
and English were still almost silent.</p>

<p>Gwalchmai, the son of a distinguished father, Meilir,
already mentioned, was among the first of the
revived school, whose work is regarded by Celtic
scholars as of the first quality. His love of nature is
prominent in many of the poems he has left:</p>

<div class="cpoem27">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;At the break of day, and at evening&rsquo;s close,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I love the sweet musicians who so fondly dwell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In dear, plaintive murmurs, and the accents of woe;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I love the birds and their sweet voices<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the soothing lays of the wood.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Owain Gwynedd was the hero-king of Gwalchmai&rsquo;s
day. His repulse of an attack made by Henry the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>340]</a></span>
Second&rsquo;s fleet under the command of an unpatriotic
Prince of Powys in Anglesey is the subject of the
bard&rsquo;s chief heroic poem:</p>

<div class="cpoem27">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Now thickens still the frantic war,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The flashing death-strokes gleam afar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spear rings on spear, flight urges flight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And drowning victims plunge to-night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till Menai&rsquo;s over-burthened tide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wide-blushing with the streaming gore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And choked with carnage, ebbs no more;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While mail-clad warriors on her side<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In anguish drag their deep-gash&rsquo;d wounds along,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And &rsquo;fore the King&rsquo;s Red chiefs are heap&rsquo;d the mangled throng.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Owain Cyfeiliog, a Prince of Powys in the end of
the twelfth century, though a noted warrior, is a
leading instance of a royal bard. His chief poem,
<i>The Hirl&acirc;s Horn</i> (drinking-cup), is famous wherever
Welsh is spoken:</p>

<div class="cpoem20">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;This horn we dedicate to joy;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then fill the Hirl&acirc;s horn, my boy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That shineth like the sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose azure handles tipped with gold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Invite the grasp of Britons bold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sons of liberty.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This is one of the longest poems of the twelfth
century. The scene is the night after a battle, and
the Prince with his warriors gathered round him in
the banqueting-hall sends the brimming cup to each
of his chieftains successively and enumerates their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>341]</a></span>
respective deeds. A leading incident in the poem is
when Owen, having eulogised the prowess of two
favourite warriors in glowing terms, turns to their
accustomed seats, and, finding them vacant, suddenly
recalls the fact that they had fallen in the battle of
the morning:</p>

<div class="cpoem26">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Ha! the cry of death&mdash;And do I miss them!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O Christ! how I mourn their catastrophe!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O lost Moreiddig&mdash;How greatly shall I need thee!&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>A most suggestive poem by another Prince is a
kind of summary of his progress through his dominions
from the Ardudwy mountains,</p>

<div class="cpoem19">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Fast by the margin of the deep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where storms eternal uproar keep,&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>to the hills above Llangollen where he proposes &ldquo;to
taste the social joys of Yale.&rdquo; This is Howel, the
illegitimate son of Owain Gwynedd, who seized and
held for two years his father&rsquo;s kingdom. Though
so strenuous a warrior, his poems are rather of love
and social life. He sings with much feeling of the
joys of Wales; her fair landscape, her bright waters
and green vales, her beauteous women and skimming
seagulls, her fields clothed with tender trefoil,
her far-reaching wilds, and plenteousness of game.
Himself a successful stormer of castles, there is something
richly suggestive in the action of a man laying
down the torch and bloody sword and taking up the
pen to describe his havoc:</p>

<div class="cpoem21">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;The ravens croaked and human blood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In ruddy streams poured o&rsquo;er the land;<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>342]</a></span>
<span class="i0">There burning houses war proclaimed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Churches in flames and palace halls;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While sheets of fire scale the sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And warriors &lsquo;On to battle!&rsquo; cry.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then the author wholly changes his mood:</p>

<div class="cpoem27">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Give me the fair, the gentle maid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of slender form, in mantle green;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose woman&rsquo;s wit is ever staid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Subdued by virtue&rsquo;s graceful mien.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Give me the maid, whose heart with mine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall blend each thought, each hope combine;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, maiden fair as ocean&rsquo;s spray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gifted with Kymric wit&rsquo;s bright ray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Say, am I thine?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Art thou then mine?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What! silent now?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy silence makes this bosom glow.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I choose thee, maiden, for thy gifts divine;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&rsquo;Tis right to choose&mdash;then, fairest, choose me thine.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>There is much misunderstanding as to the fashion
in which the bards were treated by Edward the First.
During war the leading minstrels were naturally
identified with the patrons whose banners they
followed and whose praises they sang; but the
statement that they were put to death as bards rests
on wholly secondary authority and seems doubtful.
Stringent laws were certainly made against the lower
order of minstrels who wandered homeless through
the country, but they seem to have been devised as
much for the protection of the common people, who
were called on to support them, as against the men
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>343]</a></span>
themselves, who were regarded by the authorities as
mendicants and idlers. The superior bards, who kept
strictly to the houses of the great, were probably
not often interfered with. These, though they had
regular patrons and fixed places of abode, made extended
tours from time to time in which there seems
to have been no special distinction between North
and South Wales. The hatred of the bards towards
England was a marked feature of their time, and
was so consistent that though many Welsh princes,
in their jealousy, lent their swords, as we have seen,
to the invader, no bards, so far as one knows, turned
against their countrymen. For generations they
prided themselves in being intellectually superior to
the Saxon. They also saw, after the Norman conquest,
the English race despised and held down by
their conquerors, and a species of serfdom in use
among the Saxons which had no prototype in their
own country. The ordinary bards, however, had beyond
all doubt sacrificed much of their old independence
and become the creatures of their patrons and
ready to sell their praises for patronage. Even the
respectable Meilir confesses:</p>

<div class="cpoem19">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;I had heaps of gold and velvet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From frail princes for loving them.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Llewelyn the Great, the second, that is to say, of the
three Llewelyns, aroused the enthusiasm of Bardic
literature and was the subject of much stirring
eulogy:</p>

<div class="cpoem21">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;None his valour could withstand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">None could stem his furious hand.<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>344]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Like a whirlwind on the deep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">See him through their squadrons sweep.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then was seen the crimson flood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then was Offa bathed in blood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then the Saxons fled with fright,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then they felt his royal might.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Dafydd Benvras, the author of this stanza, left many
poems, and later on Griffith ap Yr Ynad Goch wrote
what is regarded as among the finest of Welsh odes,
on the death of the last Llewelyn, laying the blame
of that catastrophe on the wickedness of his countrymen:</p>

<div class="cpoem22">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Hark how the howling wind and rain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In loudest symphony complain;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">With thundering crash proclaim he&rsquo;s gone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fall in each other&rsquo;s arms and groan.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hark! how the sullen trumpets roar.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">See! how the white waves lash the shore.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">See how eclipsed the sun appears,<br /></span>

<p>After the Edwardian conquest in 1284 the note of
the bards sensibly softened and attuned itself much
more generally to love and nature. The song-birds
particularly were in great request as recipients of
poetic addresses and confidences.</p>

<p>While the same singer, Rhys Goch, describes thus the
light tread of his ladylove:</p>

<span class="i0">Not e&rsquo;en a trefoil bends its head.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>

<p>The latter part of the 14th century was extremely
prolific in poetry which, with some notable exceptions,
is regarded rather as showing a good general
level than as producing any masterpieces. Dafydd
ap Gwilym, the Welsh Ovid, is of course a striking
exception. Over 250 of his poems are preserved,
while Lewis Glyncothi, Gutyn Owain, Iolo Goch,
Glyndwr&rsquo;s bard, and two or three more have left behind
them something like 300 others. Dafydd ap
Gwilym, who was buried at Strata Florida, holds one
of the highest places in Cymric literature. It is as a
love poet that he is chiefly distinguished, but his love
of nature and his own beautiful country finds sole expression
in many of his productions. His ode to
Fair Glamorgan, written from &ldquo;the heart of wild,
wild Gwynedd,&rdquo; asking the summer to be his
messenger, is regarded as one of his best. In translation
it is interesting as a contemporary picture,
though a poetic one, of the richest Welsh province.</p>

<p>Quotations have already been made in the body
of this book from Iolo Goch&rsquo;s ode to Glyndwr, and
throughout the Wars of the Roses Lewis Glyncothi,
Gutyn Owain, and Tudor Aled continued to sing of
contemporary events.</p>

<p>The leading charge against Cymric poetry is that
it is too prone to elaborate the mere art of versification
at the expense of fire and animation. Alliteration
was of course the chief method of ornament,
though the rhyming of the terminal syllable was by
no means always ignored. But, speaking generally,
skill in the arrangement of words according to certain
time-honoured conventions occupied more than
an equitable share in the making of Welsh verse. A
tendency to put mere sound above feeling and emotion
did much to cramp it, and often forced it into mannerisms
and affectations that would rather destroy
than enhance the intrinsic merits of a composition.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Beyond all rhetorical ornaments,&rdquo; says Giraldus Cambrensis,
&ldquo;they preferred the use of alliteration and that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>347]</a></span>
kind more especially which repeats the first letters or
syllables of words. They made so much use of this
ornament in every finished discourse that they thought
nothing elegantly spoken without it.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mr. Stephens, by way of illustration, points out
poems by the greater bards which from the first line
to the last commence with the same letter. He also
attributes the extraordinary elaboration in structure
with which fashion was prone to cumber Welsh
poetry to a desire for increasing the difficulties of
composition and in consequence the exclusiveness of
the bardic order. It is not surprising that in a
country where war was the chief business of life it
should be by far the favourite subject of the minstrel,
particularly when one remembers that the celebration
of his employer&rsquo;s exploits or intended exploits was
the chief source of the domestic poet&rsquo;s livelihood.
The wars of Glyndwr stirred again the old fighting
note which after the Edwardian conquest had given
way in a great measure to gentler themes. The old
laws against the bards, enunciated by Edward I.,
now for long a dead letter, were renewed, but after
this final submission of Wales it is doubtful if they
continued to have much meaning, particularly amid
the chaos of the ensuing Wars of the Roses, when
the bards most certainly did their full share of singing.</p>

<p>I have said nothing of the music which both in early
and medi&aelig;val Wales played such a prominent part
in the national life. The harp was always the true
national instrument, though the pipe or bagpipe was
well known and in frequent use; but it was never
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>348]</a></span>
really popular, as in Ireland and Scotland, and this
was surely a valuable testimony to the superior culture
of the Welsh musicians. Griffith ap Kynan,
King of North Wales about 1100, already mentioned,
introduced it into the Eisteddfod as the
result of his Irish education. The pipes had hitherto
been forbidden, and the result at the celebrated
Eisteddfod at Caerwys was that Griffith&rsquo;s prize of a
silver pipe went to a Scotsman. The Welsh, in short,
despised the instrument. Lewis Glyncothi has
left an amusing satire on a piper. He finds himself
in Flint at an English marriage, where the guests
would have none of him or his harp, but &ldquo;bawled
for Will the Piper, low born wretch&rdquo; who comes forward
as best he may, &ldquo;unlike a free enobled man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Giraldus, half Welshman himself, writing after his
extended tour through Wales, about 1200, with
Archbishop Baldwin, says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The strangers who arrived in the morning were entertained
until evening with the conversation of young
women and with the music of the harp, for in this country
almost every house is provided with both. Such an
influence had the habit of music on the mind and its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>349]</a></span>
fascinating powers, that in every family or in every tribe,
they esteemed skill in playing on the harp beyond any
kind of learning. Again, by the sweetness of their musical
instruments they soothe and delight the ear. They
are rapid yet delicate in their modulation, and by the
astonishing execution of their fingers and their swift
transitions from discord to concord, produce the most
pleasing harmony.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The part-singing of the Welsh seems also to have
greatly struck Giraldus in contrast to the unison in
which he heard the musicians of other nations
perform.</p>

<p>To draw the line between the bard and musician
would be of course impossible. Many writers of
verse could only declaim; some could sing to their
own accompaniment. The mass of musicians, how
ever, we may take it, belonged to the lower grade of
wandering bards, who played first, as we have seen,
upon the national instrument, the harp, as well as
upon the pipe and &ldquo;crwth&rdquo; (a kind of rude violin).</p>

<p>The tone of morality was certainly not high among
the medi&aelig;val Welsh bards. They had long lost all
touch with the order of the priesthood, and indeed
monks and poets had become almost as a matter of
course inimical to one another. The latter, too,
maintained a steady hatred of the Saxon that was almost
creditable, seeing how often their masters, for
the sake of interest or revenge, took up arms against
their fellow-countrymen.</p>

<p>It is sufficiently difficult merely to touch, and that
in the slightest manner, so vast a subject as this.
In recognising the insufficiency of such an attempt,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>350]</a></span>
I am almost thankful that the period of Glyndwr and
the succeeding turmoil of the Wars of the Roses puts
a reasonable limit to my remarks. For it goes without
saying that when Wales settled down under the
Tudors to its happy and humdrum existence, the
martial attitude of the bards as feudal appanages
and national firebrands altogether ceased. Welsh
poets hereafter were private individuals, their song
ceased for the most part to be of war; nor was the
Saxon or the Lloegrian any longer an object of invective.
The glory of this new United Britain to
which they belonged was not without its inspiration,
but it has been by no means a leading note in Welsh
verse, which, speaking generally, has since in this
particular sung upon a minor key.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">The Story of the Nations.</h2>


<p>Messrs. G.&nbsp;P. PUTNAM&rsquo;S SONS take pleasure in
announcing that they have in course of publication, in
co-operation with Mr. T. Fisher Unwin, of London, a
series of historical studies, intended to present in a graphic
manner the stories of the different nations that have
attained prominence in history.</p>

<p>In the story form the current of each national life is
distinctly indicated, and its picturesque and noteworthy
periods and episodes are presented for the reader in their
philosophical relation to each other as well as to universal
history.</p>

<p>It is the plan of the writers of the different volumes to
enter into the real life of the peoples, and to bring them
before the reader as they actually lived, labored, and
struggled&mdash;as they studied and wrote, and as they amused
themselves. In carrying out this plan, the myths, with
which the history of all lands begins, will not be overlooked,
though these will be carefully distinguished from
the actual history, so far as the labors of the accepted
historical authorities have resulted in definite conclusions.</p>

<p>The subjects of the different volumes have been planned
to cover connecting and, as far as possible, consecutive
epochs or periods, so that the set when completed will
present in a comprehensive narrative the chief events in
the great <span class="smcap">Story of the Nations</span>; but it is, of course,
not always practicable to issue the several volumes in
their chronological order.</p>

<div class="bbox">
<p><b>Transcriber's Note</b></p>

<p>The author uses some extensive variations in the spelling of proper
nouns. This is sometimes variation between Welsh and English, or
sometimes within either the Welsh or the English. Except where there
was a definite error or clear prevalence of one form over another,
these variations are preserved as printed. Those which have been
amended are as follows:</p>

<div class="amends">

</div>

<p>The author explicitly thanks a W. D. Haydon for photographs used in
the book, however the List of Illustrations references this person as
W. D. Hayson. The List of Illustrations and the credit under the
photograph have both been amended, as the transcriber found other
photographs attributed to Haydon, but none to Hayson.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_267">267</a> mentions L&oelig;gira. This is probably an error for L&oelig;gria,
but as it is part of an extended quotation, is preserved as printed.</p>

<p>Minor punctuation errors have been repaired. Hyphenation usage has
been made consistent.</p>

<p>The following amendments have been made:</p>

<div class="amends">
<p>Page <a href="#Page_xvi">xvi</a>&mdash;MANORBRIER amended to MANORBIER&mdash;MANORBIER CASTLE 262</p>

<p>The index entries for Sir John Cornwall, Doncaster, and Lichfield,
were out of order. They have been moved to the correct place. Note also
that Elizabeth Scudamore is listed in the index under E, while Alice
Scudamore and Philip Scudamore are listed under S. These have been
preserved as printed.</p>

<p>The frontispiece illustration has been moved to follow the title page.
Other illustrations have been moved where necessary so that they are
not in the middle of a paragraph.</p>

<p>Credits in the List of Illustrations were originally set as footnotes.
The transcriber has instead put the appropriate credit below each item.</p>

<p>The transcriber has added links to the beginning of the index for ease of
